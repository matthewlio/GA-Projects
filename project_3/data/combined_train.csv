42,0, of eating exercise so many people ask how one is supposed to eat calorie in a day when they only eat half that right now. thats asking how am i supposed to bench when i only bench now no one expects you to double up your intake tomorrow just no one expects you to throw two plate on the second day in the gym. i mean maybe some people can but most of u cant just do that and it becomes very discouraging when thats seen a the one thing thats holding you back. set a goal and slowly ramp up towards it just you any exercise. if you eat today goal towards by increasing your daily intake by calorie per week. in week youll be eating all that and it wont be painful. thats an extra cliff bar a day v what you did last week. not crazy. maybe you can go faster. maybe it take a little longer. but set your goal and do it at a pace that doesnt discourage you make you feel shit or keep you from getting what you want out of your lifts. you have to train yourself to eat that and you have to eat that to gain.

76,0,whats the point so reading around here and other forum it seems that to be the size of normal men skinny guy have to stick to a strict eating and workout regiment for the rest of their lives. i honestly cant even see the point of trying. the majority of men around me will never lift a weight or count a calorie in their life yet will be twice my size. i so many people irl who eat le than my standard mcdonalds meal two cheeseburger nugget and a large fry cal for their entire day yet they are pushing lb not of pure muscle but they are actual filled out men unlike me i eat that meal every single day and ontop of that around calorie of frozen meal and ramen every single day. ampxb i am stuck fluctuating between and lb at ampxb i do nothing with my life otherwise i am completely sedentary. i move from my bed to my desk to the kitchen table to grab the mcdonalds my mom brings to the bathroom to my room once again. i cannot bring myself to go out this i feel shame and disguist when i see my slender disguisting figure in a mirror when i see my thin arm poking out of my hoodie malnourished stick i feel i look so rididculous and horrible some freak cartoon character from billy and mandy. and when i really look at myself and see my fairly normal sized head on this freakishly scrawny body it so uncanny it make me feel sick in my stomach. ampxb and it not just in my mind i have heard people cracking joke about how skinny i am under their voice when i pas by return group on hiking trail nevemind in the hallway when i wa still in high school. i have heard bros giggling when i walked by at planet fitness and then proceed to scramble to take up all the equipment so they wont lose it to someone who will take forever doing light rep and make them wait which is why i no longer go to the gym it happened time so i never went back ampxb tldr calorie calculator say i calorie a day i take in minimum usually more yet i am still scrawny ampxb ampxb if you go to comment some platitude about how people are beautiful at any weight and that me being so skinny that girl hold their arm up to mine to compare and laugh is fine and that alot of men i see posturing against me because of how much bigger they are is okay then find somewhere to be useless.

239,0,weekly calorie i often see people on this sub say that weekly calorie are more important than daily calorie but i understand how that work in regard to gaining muscle. when losing fat if youre aiming for a cal deficit you can make up for only being in a calorie deficit on monday by being in a calorie deficit on friday. but with building muscle you cant really do that can you if youre aiming for a surplus and hit on monday you cant just eat on friday and build the lost muscle right wouldnt the extra cals just go to fat i it go without saying that this doesnt really matter that much but im curious a i see it mentioned sometimes here and doesnt make sense to me.

288,0,calories in calorie out is kinda bs. i mean the general idea is true but what you eat actually doe matter. eating calorie of fast food and pasta versus calorie of chicken breast and broccoli is going to have a different effect in how that weight is gained and how you feel. i have been sort of half clean half dirty bulking and over the holiday i let it go full dirty bulk a i went to my grandmas and ate whatever wa served instead of being some calorie counting autist. i did make my shake in the morning but other than that i ate whatever i wanted. basically hot pocket burgerville potato skin pasta hamburger helper and more burgerville. i feel bloated now i hate this belly. i just feel tired at it now i absolutely hate having a bloated belly and not having a flat stomach. i wa also into how certain celebrity get cut for role and it not just calorie in calorie out. their meal are meticulously prepared. for instance when getting shredded for tarzan alexander skarsgard wa trained by magnus lygdback and basically couldnt have certain carbs pasta soda alcohol etc he wa also told to avoid salt a salt bind water. he also had to avoid sugar and gluten since no risk were to be taken. so my point is calorie in calorie out is misleading. i feel bloated. had i been eating nothing but chicken breast and broccoli i doubt id feel bloated.

320,0,m lbs. ive been trying to gain the last month. but feel i have failed miserably. so first some history i started working out avout five year ago quite fat and zero strength i mean i struggled doing knee push ups. but i started working out with a trainer and the coming year and a half i lost about lbs. but then about three year ago i got burned out hit the famous wall and since i have battled quite a serious depression with high daily anxiety bad sleep and the whole recipe for a shit life. and training ha come and gone ive went up and down in weight. just last winter i had a really bad period where i didnt workout or really eat so i lost about lb without wanting to and mostly muscle. i wa down to around pound and still had some love handle and a shit. but now for the last month ive been trying to eat in a slight surplus to get more energy and hopefully put on some muscle but im afraid i have failed miserably and just put on more fat. i store most fat in the back a big pinch of love handle im not feeling much stronger and you cant really see any difference from the front in the picture i have taken over these months. even though strength and functionality is more important to me than looks. i have had a really hard time putting on any muscle and more importantly strength. i did speak with the trainer on my gym about if she it if i started training with her and she said that it probably not my knowledge thats the problem but more likely that my body is in such a stressed state that build muscle isnt really it priority right now. so i thats the why im not being able to gain strength. yet i thought it couldnt hurt to ask for some  or just some helpful word of encouragement. maybe some have new and insightful to tell me. for the last week ive tried a push pull leg split. i havent really gained any weight in at all in a while now and feel kind of stuck once again. plus the last two week during the holiday ive been bad with keeping it up. but im back at it again. progress so far. and im converting from cm to inches. starting out in july weight lb chest waist hip thigh now weight lb chest . waist . hip thing . biceps flexed my goal is to have a surplus of about kcal per day with g protein. as i wrote i have begun with an push pull and leg program and a goal to workout time a week. with the program im trying to hit each muscle group set per week and im training to near failure. starting the workout heavier ending lighter. example my back day is every exercise is set of reps. . pull ups. . one armed machine row. . wide grip cable row. . ezbar preacher curls. . shoulder rotation with resistance band. . trx rows. . and ending with some stomachcore exercise and stretching. and i have done this for about weeks. but im already struggling to progress. and havent really gained any weight in a while now. yet im afraid of eating more and just keep on gaining fat.
321,0,update eating a frozen pizza at midnight for consecutive day all this is an update to the post one month ago i forgot to make. ive tried to gain weight before with the recommended method such a eating nut or making shake and having lot of small meal throughout the day. while it did work it always fell apart after a while a it wa too variable to consistently do. one of the shake ingredient wouldve ran out or my day planning made it impossible to eat time and i never really looked forward to eating any of these extra meals. thats when i came up with the idea to add a frozen pizza to my daily routine. eating junk food without a second thought is the triedandtested method of getting fat so i figured it work for me a well. the idea wa simple consume a pizza at the end of every day for month straight. this post will be me sharing my experience feel free to comment or give feedback about anything advantages extremely easy while im sure that thing speed up once you get in the flow of making shake or meal prepping nothing beat frozen pizza. its literally throwing it in the oven eating it and rinsing your plate. this make it a lot easier to eat on day you feel it. simple logistics no for many different ingredient or keeping track of when expires. you can simply buy a stack of pizza and store them for a long a needed. quite cheap before this experiment i actually went through my city buying all the offbrand pizza in every store. while some cent pizza were sweet in the end i settled for a good tasting one. pricepercaloriewise this seems a good deal to me. tasty i mean it pizza. disadvantages starts to get repetitive personally i care about this so much but most of you probably want to eat the same every single day. not that healthy.. initially i figured it is just bread with cheese and tomato but reading up on some material while making this post show me it might be a lot worse. the main reason being ldls and a high salt amount however upon closer inspection my pizza doesnt seem that bad ill leave the specific here so some of the more nutritionally informed gent can comment. it ha gram of protein though which is a happy surprise. kcalg fat .g saturatedg carbs .g sugarg fibresg protein.g salt results in the last day i have eaten frozen pizza one wa replaced with kebab. i went from . to . kg a solid increase im very happy with the first day i wasnt always eager to eat after dinner but very quickly my body became accustomed to the feeling. now i even feel the urge to eat in the evening almost a if ive conditioned my body is this what they call appetite. strangely enough there quite some morning in which i feel really hungry now whereas before i never want to eat after waking up. i consider this experiment a success and will definitely continue with it however it might be a good idea to cycle between different food throughout the day for health and taste reasons. let me what you

338,0,how important is it to get multiple source of protein i wa eating a bag of chicharrones and noticed on the back that it said not a significant source of protein even though there is g per serving. i wa confused because there are serving in a . ounce bag. g of protein per . ounce certainly seems significant. turns out protein is just a blanket term for amino acids. i kind of remembered from h biology but never really thought about when it came to nutrition. the reason chicharrones are not considered a significant source of protein is because the specific amino acid in them are not very useful for our bodies. so i am what amino acid are really important that the average person might not be getting enough of and will eating the same two or three protein source all the time have any negative effect

368,0,its so much harder to gain weight when you cant eat any added sugar literally almost of thing include added sugars. i unfortunately cannot eat added sugar because they cause severe acne. this in turn force me to have to cook a lot of my meal and use unprocessed raw foods. eating chip cooky snacksor eating out is super hard and hardly ever do it. a simple burger could cause me an acne flair if it ha too much sugarbread and condiment have added sugar. i read the label on healthy snack and they pack so much calorie for such a small meal but i cannot eat them. the best thing to combat this ha probably been nut and seeds. if ha any other food recommendation let me  peanut or almond butter is also good a long a it only includes it natural sugars.

465,0, after medical issue interrupted bulk everybody im for a little personalized here the context m . i had been bulking for a little over a year and have managed to go from gt . im very happy with my progress and my plan wa to continue to bulk until around or then try to lean down a bit for the summer. but then i wa diagnosed with a medical issue that made it nearly impossible to even eat maintenance so i decided to make the most of it and cut for a bit which ha been going well. however ive been taking prescription and should be back to normal in a week or two. my is should i pick up my bulk where i left off right away or should i finish my cut to about body fat first if it make a difference when i wa diagnosed i wa somewhere between body fat and my cut ha been going smoothly im currently around and havent lost any strength. my thought is i could consider this a minicut and i could gain more mass and still be able to cut down because there is a lot of time before summer but im unsure if there are any adverse effect for an intermediate lifter switching back and forth this. on the other hand i could finish the cut and lean bulk through the entirety of summer. ask any that be helpful.

567,0,physical transformation is an uncomfortable process a discussion greetings once again gainers intro i feel the time ha come to discus that many of the regular may believe is obvious but based upon recent observation seems to not be well expressed. the process of physical transformation is an uncomfortable process. what kinds of discomfort can we expect the discomfort from eating. this includes the very discomfort that come with simply eating to the point of fullness and beyond. it also mean the experience of bloating that come along with eating certain calorie dense food that can be rough on the digestive track. it also mean the discomfort that come from eating when not hungry. you have to remember your instinct have resulted in your current state. you must now act opposite of your instincts. this is going to cause the discomfort of cognitive dissonance. the discomfort of training. i am notorious for saying i hate training and thats because i being uncomfortable and training when done correctly is uncomfortable. you will be forced to strain be out of breath feel ache and soreness and push to the point of collapse in some instances. the conditioning training you do which is absolutely necessary will burn your heart and lung and make you want to quit. you will also experience the discomfort of fear putting more weight on the bar than you did the last time so that you can progress and fearing the unknown of that experience. if your training is comfortable there a fair chance it not helping you grow. the discomfort of the transformation itself. ive written about this before hell this whole post is a rehash really but in the process of going from scrawnyunfit to jacked there will be time where we look worse. for some reason facesjaws are the topic du jour so allow me to answer this silly yes your face will get fuller a you gain weight. its part of the process. along with that your previously razor sharp ab will get blurry and possibly even disappear for a while. this is the softening process that every jacked person ha undergone. the exception are just that exceptions. how to tell that you arent one of those youre reading this post. that mean youre on the rgainit subreddit which mean muscle gain doe not come easynaturally to you. so stop trying to live the exception and use the process that ha been proven to work for decades. you will have to undergo a period of time wherein in the pursuit of gaining muscle you put on some most likely necessary bodyfat. as a rgainit resident you really shouldnt be that worried anyway because clearly youre awesome at losing weight. and on that note when you start to lose the fat you will actually look worse than you did at the start of the cut simply because youll deplete your glycogen store and have your muscle look flat compared to when they were full. ride that out for week and it will selfcorrect. on the above i do want to point out that if you are getting fat a in truly fat you most likely arent experiencing enough discomfort from the eating and training. the discomfort of compromised time. no one ha time to cook eat and train. not a single person on the planet does. people that succeed at this endeavor make time. making time is very uncomfortable. this may require putting hobby on hold not being caught up on netflix sleeping le spending money on cooking appliance to speed up the process becoming talented at multitasking being le social etc. some practice and planning can ease the discomfort. i have an instant pot and a ninja foodi in along with a dishwasher. this saturday while i wa unloading grocery for the week i had meal cooking in the ninja and wa unloadingreloading the dishwasher a dish accumulated. id rather have been on the couch watching netflix which here a tip watch man v food to build your appetite but then i not have met my goal. the discomfort of spending money. money is valuable. thats a very literal statement. but the value of money is it ability to be exchanged for good and services. in the process of physical transformation you will to eat more food than you were before. this is going to mean spending more money than you were doing before. and if you care about your body since youre going to be putting so much food through it it most likely a good idea to buy quality food which cost even more than ramen noodle and ketchup. even the gallon of milk a day approach is going to require you to set aside some finance to say nothing of if you want some kitchen gadget meal prep container etc. if you are not in a financial situation to be able to support your physical transformation process it most likely a better idea to put that process on hold accumulate fund and use the downtime to prepare yourself. get in good physical condition study free resource and come up with a solid financial gameplan. key takeaway discomfort is not a sign of failure so frequently people post topicsquestions here wherein they are experiencing discomfort and want to how to fix it. there is no fix this is the process working. that is the feeling you are feeling. physical transformation is an uncomfortable process. were it not there be far more jacked people walking around. instead what you observe in your day to day life are people who are the byproduct of a life of comfort. if that is your goal continue being comfortable. but if you want to change you will to experience discomfort. conclusion let us im not heartless here. quite the opposite in fact i am so excited about this sub. its my favorite sub on primarily because i love the start of the journey a far a physical transformation goes. it only happens once and it such a cool experience. you can watch yourself transform month to month. i will gladly become more uncomfortable i so many way to do that. ive been training for year and made a ton of mistake along the way and i made them so that you have to. and im not alone in that regard. we have several awesome contributor to the sub here and many are not a solipsistic a me and wont write topic for themselves and will just you along the way all out of pure altruism. but we to be met halfway here. if youre not willing to experience discomfort we cannot  if you embrace it we have so many tool to  as always love to discus and answer questions.

690,0,lifting getting me down im a beginner to lifting im about to hit six month of going very consistently. its been going ok physically and ive made alright progress on the lift gained a decent amount of weight. but unlike almost everyone i talk to that work out who say they feel really good after working out that it improves their mood etc going to the gym make me feel worse. very consistently the four day i go to the gym i feel much worse mentallymoodwise than the other day and i leave the gym feeling more gloomy than i went in basically every time. about lifting just make me feel more hopeless than almost any other activity. even though i can see myself making progress every pound i add on a lift just make me realize how much further my goal are from where i am now. ive been the weakest scrawniest man in every gym ive been to and every session i just look at all the other guy and feel shit because of how bad i look and how many year and year itll be before i look any of them. and beyond any specific thought it just an intrinsic thing every time i lift i just immediately start to feel sad or mad or grouchy and i really why. i used to be fine with my body confident and whatever but now that i workout and realize how weak i am and how far i have to go my confidence ha totally disappeared. i am sooo much more critical of my body now that i a few thing than i wa when i had never thought about fitness before. even though ive made some progress i am so much more critical that i still end up thinking worse of myself than i did before. besides that just seeing how slow the progress is and how after month which i isnt that long but still i look visibly different even though ive gotten stronger just make me feel so defeated and make the lifting stop being fun and feel this horrible chore i have to do instead. i love to get the workout endorphin or rush or mood lift that everyone talk about instead of this. has experienced this or have idea on how to make the gym more of a moodraising instead of moodlowering thing and just tell me to quit since im not enjoying it not really relevant for this post i but just for reference im m lb
691,0,gainers a discussion on chewing. ampxb a topic i have surprisingly never seemed to often come across on rgainit is chewing. we love to just down our calorie shake time a day. i i  but yea we cant do that due to societal norm and just for the sake of our own long term habitual and bodily health. eating is hard. i get that. eating protein is harder protein is the most satiating food on average. protein is definitely the backbone of any good and healthy bulking diet. now enough of reiterating the obvious. lets move on to chewing. now my mom used to claim that chewing a morsel time aid in proper digestion and stuff that. we do not have the time patience or even the energy to chew every morsel times. hell we even to do that. what we to do is however find a way to make our chew more powerful and harder. insane chew gt halfassed ones. this undoubtedly save you time leaf hunger in the tank and ensures that your food is digested properly. i encourage everyone on here to read about how their gut works. its truly a marvel to say the least. however leaving hunger in the tank is the primary goal of knowing how to chew harder and stronger. now im not telling you to eddie hall that bite of chicken pasta for your next meal. gradually bettering your chewing habit and strength will gradually build up over time and lead to very real change in your appetite and lifestyle chewing make shtting a whole lot easier if you have a disappointing lack of fiber in your diet. enough about chewing and it benefits. how do you become a better chewer if youre anything me your appetite is the least when youve just come out of the gym. i swear i could throw up any morsel which enters my mouth if it not been at least minute since ive left the gym. for other people this could be right after you brush your teeth. what im trying to say is most people have a specific window during their day when they eat and their appetite is nearly zilch. hell you could even start chewing gum during your workouts. im giving it a try on my next one. chewing gum ha been shown to improve workout performance and focus a quick search will confirm this. a caveat this will cause you to become a lot more thirsty and possibly even dehydrated during your workout. so do carry a larger water bottle or be open to making an extra trip to the water fountain. ampxb take that time and start chewing a piece of sugarless gum during it. i say sugarless a sugar just fuck with your teeth. ampxb of course you to do this. chances are youre building an impressive jaw anyways with the volume of food yall are eating. however for those who are new to gaining want to improve their eating habit and style enhance digestion consider giving this a shot. a few disclaimers. not everyone reacts to sugarfree gum the same way medically and physically. give this a try and do not take my word for granted. you can find some medicalstyle chewing gum off the net which is just unflavoured gum. it doesnt taste the best but it probably the best choice for you. also i have done nearly no scientific research for this post. this is purely anecdotal. over what ive read in the context of that. tldr chewing is important chew gum when your appetite is low or incorporate hard food to gradually build your chewing process chewing alleviate the feeling of satiation and make you subconsciously eat more.

732,0,high calorie liquid diet after surgery tips and list i had to scour the internet in advance for hours trying to find a high cal liquid diet guide for post op. i want others to go through that a mandatory liquid diet is stressful enough for those who are trying to gain. im also linking my shopping cart here so you have to search for every individual item i mention cart benecalorie it ha a ton of nutrient and vitamin on top of being calorie rich if you can afford it get it. i found that the best way to use it wa to stir it in really hot water first then add it to your food. it make the texture and taste disappear imo. savory food stick to cream soups. blending thing that shouldnt be soup end up in a cognitive dissonance that is frankly upsetting and can lead to nausea. add a tablespoon or more of olive oilsesame oil per serving. i preferred sesame oil. canned chili is the only food that wa surprisingly good when blended. my favorite soup turned out to be creamy chicken dumplings and cream of chicken. both are around calorie per can the former to be blended but doesnt feel wrong when it is. cream of mushroom or potato is good too it about per can. adding creme fraiche and some melted butter is good too it make them taste better and add the calories. sweet food these will keep you from losing your sanity. make a ton of milkshakes. endless milkshakes. key tip use half and half instead of milk. add frozen fruit if youre lacking vitamin c i found the strawberry kiwi vitamin c powder flavor wa completely hidden in the shake. protein powder wa also a great add and you couldnt taste or feel it. condensed milk is delicious and calorie rich.

744,0,weight gain 
745,0,wrists limiting my potential finally hit a plate bench. heaviest and strongest ive been in my life. one of my biggest concern is now coming to light. i have tiny wrist and pressing that kg it felt they were going to implode on themselves. still sore now the day after. yes my bar path and placement is fine. is this a genetic limitation if my bench stall will most of my progression im done moaning about small wrist when it come to size ive accepted that theyre tiny and no amount of forearm work will change that. im just feeling down because i want to get to plate but i honestly my wrist and hand can take that amount of weight this brings me to my next point. it suck because when i want to get my ab back and cut down on some bf i will loose the only amount of tissue i have in that area which make them look a bit more full and maybe that tissue which surround them even strengthens them slightly. deadlifts and row are great unlike push day which make sense in theory i guess because of the resistance directly hitting the wrist and forearm. questionvent post idk but feel free to leave some suggestion or personal experience below.

835,0,what kind of blood test or other test should i get turning in a few days. you are probably tired of seeing me post in here but i have no other choice because i have no tolerance left for my body. from january through june i wa following the same program i am now and made great progress. i gained lb very clear i even added a whole inch to my arms. then i wa out of the gym from july through august and since i have been back my progress ha been shit. literally the only thing i changed wa i started training legs. everything ha been kept the same. i wa forward to coming back to the gym in september to continue making progress and it just feel my body lost the ability to gain muscle. people in this sub keep telling me to look at a program on the wiki but ive looked at the program there and there isnt nearly enough differentiation to what i am currently doing for my program to be the problem. and also how did i make good progress on my current program for month and then the ability magically disappeared. for some time i thought tennis which i play on off day wa hindering progress but when i about january to june i made great progress and back then i wa even playing on training day sometimes i play a full match right after a workout so i really thats my issue. i have went from at the start of the year and im now but the average person probably doesnt notice much difference in me. to be honest i going there but im sure my genetics are complete trash. unbelievably bad im foot with long arm and leg i turn in a few day so im thinking about getting a some blood test done or because it doesnt add up for my progress to be this bad at such a young age. i literally look around and people will literally gain half the weight i do in half the time and look three time a good. my lift are all increasing heck my squat ha increased by lb since i started hitting leg three month ago and no increase in leg measurement see my other post. i feel im just gaining fat which make no sense because i havent changed anything besides training legs. however for the past few month my upper body lift havent increased a fast a they were. additionally i have been feeling random weakness in my hand at random times. i did have some other nutrient blood test done and they found i wa iron and omega deficient and gave me some stuff for that but it hasnt appeared to have done shit. so basically what kind of blood test or test should i get done to figure out what is wrong with my hormone because with my progress and age i am convinced there is wrong any related to this is greatly appreciated

920,0,month progress. m lb gt lb progress pics i wa going to wait a year before i did a progress post but im having to take a break from bulking. ive lost all my apatite due to eating calorie a day for months. ive always been skinny and always felt i had a child body. putting on weight and muscle is ive always wanted to do. ive tried several time in the past but ive always given up after about month from not seeing results. i now this wa because of my diet. it seems eating and drinking protein isnt enough to put on weight this is where various fitness subreddits have helped me understand what is needed. for thats been here a while we all it come down to just eat more. my aim wa stone lb which i managed to get to. im now going on a cut just to try get my apatite back. it doe feel good not to have to about food too much and actually enjoy a meal due to feeling hungry. ive been eating only when im hungry and not really been tracking anything since i started my cut. this ha been going on for about week now and my lift have stayed the same or gone up oddly. i started lifting in april when the uk came out of lock down. i started with a full body split time a week. i did go to the gym for a th day but did a bit of cardio and conditioningphysio for my shoulder impingement. i did full body for month but noticed my lift started to plateau after about months. i then moved onto nsuns day program. i wish i started this a earlier a it so much better for linear progression. current lifts bench kg x lb squat kg x lb deadlift kg x lb i stopped deadlifting for a while a my form wa off. ive now started doing it again ohp .kg x lb ampxb diet i started with around calorie a day and tracked everything on myfitnesspal. i wa also doing intermittent fasting so all my food be eaten between am and pm. i wa quite strict to begin with and aimed for carbs fat and protein. as the weeksmonths went on i had to gradually up my calorie up to a point where i wa eating calorie a day. i wa only able to keep this up for about a week whilst doing intermittent fasting a well. i relaxed a bit on my macro and just aimed for getting enough protein and calories. i dropped intermittent fasting a my apatite wa going and it wa easier to eat k calorie in a bigger window. ampxb if i have to give any to people it will be to make sure you are eating enough and youre following a program. just go to the gym and decide on the day what you want to do. guess you calories. try measure a much a possible. if you have to estimate try under estimate. i rather eat more than my daily in take than eat less. you will have day in which you will not perform a well or even daysweeks where you progress and this can really affect you mentally. just make sure you keep going and get through it. you will also have week in which it doesnt look youve out on weight or the scale havent gone up. just keep going and try to eat more. i found weighing myself every sunday morning after going to the toilet the best method for accurate scale results. take picture before and after to see your progress. im a little annoyed i didnt take photo of my back or leg so i have nothing to compare it to. my leg have grown and my knee are le boney.

924,0,how do i get my appetite back and motivate myself to eat overview past few month ive been losing weight im just on the borderline of being underweight im sure ill be underweight in a week or two. for reference im f in july i wa about kg im now at .kg. ive been to the doctor a well who aware im losing weight and he suggested i gotta force myself to eat and he suggested complan i still to get that. the thing is i have no appetite i can only eat about one full meal a day. eating seems a chore. i got food poisoning or a stomach bug in late august and since then my appetite hasnt been the same. my stomach will be hungry but i wont be hungry if that make sense lol
925,0,whats wrong with staying skinny while eating normally yo male and pounds. i eat on average calorie a day which i believe is perfectly normal for my height. i this sub is dedicated to people who want to eat more to look better or but is there anything wrong living this while eating normally if you care about your appearance too much i swear that people in here will be screaming that my weight is critically low for my height and that i should be eating more. but if im eating enough calorie for my height right now why i to forcefeed myself to bulk up im perfectly happy where i am but objectively im still critically low. so whats up with that eating normally is just bad for my health ampxb additional info i go rock climbing and bouldering time a week. i have been doing this for the past year and it without a doubt one of my greatest source of happiness mentally and physically so lifting pointless metal plate isnt going to replace that for me ever. however i still consider myself in shape even though im beyond lean only muscle not fat. im a programmer and a music producer so i sit at my computer all day. my mom weight pound and my dad is also very skinny so im not an outlier in my family. i genetics are only an excuse for people who want to bulk up but im just saying. ampxb usual diet morning protein shake banana mango strawberry greek yogurt protein milk orange juice and flax peanut butter jelly toasts. granola bar snack lunch salad with vegetable chicken breast tuna and dressing. yogurt cheese and cashew snack. dinner huge plate of pasta with meat sauce or chicken fish with cup of white rice and vegetables. cookies desert and other snack later chip or

929,0,my experience with ptsd stomach pain and lack of appetite i am a year old male and i have complex post traumatic stress disorder. im crossposting this from ptsd in in hope it will others who have similar issue with lack of appetite. do not consider this medical  i first started experiencing symptom about two year ago when the world went into lockdown. i be hungry all the time but have no appetite. coupled with the pain in my stomach it wa nearly impossible to force any food down. i could chew a piece of food forever but trying to swallow it make me gag. id sit and stare at my favorite steak and potato for an hour before tossing it in the trash still hungry and in pain. i started drinking a lot of soup. for the past two year my diet consisted mostly of soup at least until late at night when the symptom subside. i went to several doctor all with a different diagnosis. the gp said i had heartburn and put me on antacids. the nutritionist told me i wa eating wrong and put me on a fodmap diet. the psychiatrist told me i had cptsd and put me on ssris. the gastroenterologist told me i had h. pylori so i had a endoscopy. the neurologist told me i may have a tumor pressing against so i had an mri. my liver heart and spleen were all checked. after a year of this and worth of medical bill later nothing helped. in fact the several ssris i tried all made it worse with additional symptom emotional numbness. feeling hopeless i started smoking cannabis to selfmedicate. this worked wonder for my stomach pain and appetite for about half a year but i only be hungry for snacks. i began consuming an ungodly amount of snack including sweet which i usually hate. i began to experience new symptom fatigue intermittent crash throughout the day brain fog and constant pooping which i attributed to cannabis and my overeating. the weed wa helping me somewhat with the symptom but the underlying issue wa not being addressed. i wa still experiencing stomach pain and lack of appetite i wa just able to eat over it. i didnt feel i could use cannabis a a healthy longterm solution so i found myself googling for answer again at square one. at this point i felt that my pain wa likely psychosomatic a i had been probed and tested every which way for physical cause and all of those have returned negative. its also been well documented that a common symptom of ptsd wa stomach pain and lack of appetite. further reading showed that stomach pain from ptsd is caused by an imbalance in cortisol levels. i did have several of the symptom of high cortisol rapid weight gain mainly in the face and midsection contrasted with slender arm and leg a flushed and round face skin sensitivity muscle weakness mood swing and irritability. my stomach pain and lack of appetite always be the strongest in the morning and lessen at night which coincided with the way cortisol level usually appear. in contrast my symptom when i smoked cannabis coincided with low level of cortisol or adrenal fatigue. ive just found all this out this afternoon and made an appointment with my gp to confirm with proper testing but for the first time in two year i feel i finally have a viable solution and wanted to share. i hope this will with similar problems.

1139,0,is my diet stopping me from gaining weight ive always been thin my entire life. ive always liked my body but lately ive noticed that i may bee a little too thin. my recent visit to the doctor say that i weight pound and my bmi is . my work out routine is covered. i practice comptetitive archery since year ago and i can draw my pound bow with relative ease. what i want to check with you guy is my daily diet. i suspect that i might be undereating or eating stuff that a normal person eat to lose weight. breakfasts are varied. sometimes i eat scrambled egg sometimes i eat a healthy cereal with almond milk sometimes it pancake with jelly and peanut butter and sometimes it just a single square sandwich always accompanied by a glass of juice or yogurt. my lunch is alright id say. a full plate of rice salad and chicken classic thing here in the dr. the individual component change over the day sometimes it white rice sometimes it brown rice sometimes it steak instead of chicken etc. dinner. the thing i eat most for dinner is sandwiches. most night i just make myself a single square sandwich with wholemeal bread one slice of cheese one slice of ham and light mayonaise in between. other time it the same healthy cereal or in a rare night mashed potatoes. im sorry if i cant give you exact proportion i never really measure my food i just eat the same amount everytime which is a single average plate if that make sense.

1145,0,any benefit of mixing up different protein shake from different source i drink the extreme milk chocolate optimum nutrition after my workout daily. i wa at costco the other day and noticed they had these orgain premixed plant based shakes. sounded interesting because ive never had a plant based protein shake. its a oz carton and ha gram of protein. honestly it taste ok. definitely not better than the on shake i drink daily but it bearable to get down. ive been drinking these in the middle of the day or at night for a couple day because i figure it cant hurt to have an extra gram of protein and calorie from a somewhat healthy source. the ingredient seem legit. so from my understanding it ideal to get protein from different sources. but how much doe it matter if it from shake is there even any real benefit to this at all i it better to get your protein from whole foods but shake are just so damn convenient.
1146,0,pull ups not progressing greyskull i have been doing greyskull phraks variation for week consistently. my squat deadlift bench are all progressing smoothly. overhead press failed first and then ha continued to improve with the deload amrap etc. same with the barbell row. i have a regarding pullups. i wa doing negative hang and then using an assisted pullup machine to progress with pullups lowering the added weight each week. then i wa finally able to consistently do pull ups each set then then i finally once hit x. however next work out i wa back to only then then etc. it is seemingly random when and if i can do a set of . i feel confident that i can do x and relatively confident i can do x . but x is out of reach most days. should i go back to the machine go to negative again it doesnt feel the same progress a the other lifts.
1147,0,strength gains seem absolutely nonexistent recently edit im ive worked out for about year but only seriously for about months. oh boy one of these post again yeah... i hate reading these too but i where to post lol. in advance for reading just a preface my writing is likely going to be all over the place so hesitate to ask for a clarification. sorry ampxb alright so... recently ive been on a bulk cycle after a cut for about month now. ive gone from about lb to about lb so roughly .lbs per week. ish visually i believe that ive made progress you can decide here utmmediumwebxampcontext if youd since i honestly have no clue i might be totally wrong however my strength gain seem to be lacking. before you comment yes i am aware that hypertrophy training and strength training use different rep range so this could be a simple answer to my but i feel that . month of training even focusing purely on hypertrophy at least increase strength a decent amount especially a a beginner. to give an idea of my strength progression since that is what i am asking about here it is i have also been working on my form so i do drop and raise number a bit. ampxb september ndbench press no back archxlbs sept. ndsquat shitty depthxlbs oct. rdbench no back archxlbs oct. thsquat shitty depthxlbs nov thbench back arch decent formxlbs nov thsquat proper depthxlbs still not broken past lb on bench i can hit or two rep of but i rarely can increase weight and it just depressing. i am incredibly bad about keeping track of my number so i did my best to pick out the one that show any change with the two most recent one using proper or at least much better form. so what i can see and have noticed personally is that my leg have generally been increasing in strength at a rate that i find totally acceptable however all other exercise not just the one listed generally seem to be going almost nowhere. i guess to summarize my actual if i am experiencing what i is hypertrophy should i not expect my strength to move anywhere ive also been jumping between higher rep range and lower range is that bad should i separate workout into pure high replow rep thing or what im plagued with adhd so any little issue always make me everything but ive truly tried to be a patient a possible before writing this post just in case i wa jumping to conclusion but it really doe seem a though im not moving anywhere. oh and just to add in another thing that is for me to i am almost never very sore past a day or two of soreness every so often but i am literally killing myself in the gym with set per group on each day of my ppl routine going close or to failure. ampxb sorry for jumping everywhere again if you me to clarify what i meant ask. im sure i forgot some detail that are needed but who knows. for reading

1153,0,trying to bulk up on a busy schedule joined rgainit to get some pointer and motivation for bulking up. im curious to see what ha worked for others. currently male lb kg. didnt workout in highschool started doing short workout more or le daily around year ago. i live near a gym and have a very small home not much room for weight or equipment so i do a bunch of bodyweight exercises. still havent gained any weight since then. im sure part of it is genetic my father is around the same height and only weighs . still im tired of being the skinny guy. i have trouble carving out time for dedicated workouts. i spend around hr per week between work and school. all desk work. i try to eat three meal a day but the quick pace at work i will often miss my mealtime no set lunch break. sometimes i wont eat until or pm. i food intake is really important to weight gain but ive had a bit of an eating disorder most of my life. i can never keep much food down. i it take dedication and i want to put in the work where i can. ive just not had much luck with achieving my goal here and it getting a little discouraging. its really tough on the long week where summoning the motivation to work out is hard to come by. i if my story is similar to anyones but i found this subreddit and thought i could get some pointer or support from folk who had similar barrier to overcome. sorry for the long intro.

1212,0,can excess protein when being physically inactive lead to health problem specs male lb although i used to be very active and work out time a week i wa relatively new to gymming so i didnt much about dieting. i read some article on the internet and found out the calorie required for bulking around calories. i also found out that i needed around g of protein everyday when bulking. i recently bought whey protein powder but there werent any scoop included so i used a tbsp instead when making my morning smoothies. one problem wa that i wa enough to follow an article telling me that i should add tbsp of whey protein to my smoothie together with the protein that i wa already taking in a day from actual food. i later realized how inaccurate this wa when aiming for my daily protein intake since i wa adding tbsp of whey protein thinking that wa around g. i that wa actually around g of protein. two week before i bought the protein powder i injured my hand which didnt allow me to work out anymore. i waited for a while but my hand wa still hurting so i had to take a longer break from gym. i decided to make that morning smoothie that had that much protein tbsp added for about day while i wa sedentary i couldnt work out because my hand wa injured. before injuring myself i didnt use any protein powder. i am starting to feel concerned that because since i took g of protein without any physical exercise it might lead to some health problems. ive heard on the internet that excess protein might lead to kidney problem but i am not sure what to believe. have i done the wrong thing is my daily protein intake when working out good should the protein intake when being sedentary be decreased is my mistake going to cause any problem should i just stop taking protein powder in general

1292,0,the gym isnt a scary a i thought it wa for year i avoided going to the gym because the idea of going over to a weight section full of people that actually knew what they were doing made me sick. social anxiety exacerbated that feeling. i had this belief that everybody be staring at me and criticising me. there were many time i tried to start going but it never came into fruition. i always quit in the first week. i remember this one time i got everything ready and made my way over but i got cold foot a soon a i got there so i literally sat outside in the little seating area to kill time before heading home because i didnt want to tell my parent that i wasted money and didnt go. and just that my motivation fizzled out. problems i had self conscious of being skinny. i had no idea how to use the equipment. social anxiety. didnt which program to choose. difficulty consuming thousand of calories. solutions i came up with its becoming winter so now i can just throw on a hoodie and hide in it. hopefully by summer i have put on some muscle and become more confident wearing a tshirt. if i were to start in the summer i i wouldnt have stuck with it. i watched a lot of youtube videosread a lot of article and practiced my form at home. i chose to go during offpeak time at about am. during this time the gym is virtually empty and the equipment is always free. this wa helped by the fact that i chose to go to a bigger gym that wa a little further away. many others i suffered from analysis paralysis when it came to choosing a program. i spend month researching dozen of program and comparing them against each other. i wa for that perfect one but in actuality there never is. i the best here is to just choose one and stick with it. about it this. any program is better than no program. youll make progress with whatever program you choose versus being unsure and never stepping foot in the gym. food wa one of the biggest limiting factors. a lot of people recommended high calorie shake to bump up those number but i personally didnt them a theyre very thick and tasted horrible. drinking it wa a chore. porridge ha been my no. goto to make sure i reach my caloric goal each and every day. my version contains about calories. ive been eating this every morning without fail and i enjoy it very much. the best thing is it very customisable. oh and invest in a food scale. it make tracking the food you eat hundred of time easier. i speak a if ive been at the gym for a long time but it only really been two weeks. squats killed my leg the first day and i couldnt walk right the rest of the week. the doms lessened the more i went. also the people ive interacted with when i asked for with were very kind and helpful. you quickly realise that all your fearsqualms were lie your brain wa feeding you. i feel ive learned a lot and i hope to stick with it now that ive built somewhat of a foundation. the best thing is ive seen small change in my body. its probably water weight but it a good indication that im going in the right direction. if i had known what i now i wouldve started year ago. believe in yourself and youll be glad you did.

1376,0,progress m lb in week or why you to limit yourself to lean gains in the last little while ive noticed quite a few post about lean gaining the maximum amount of muscle a person can put on how going above a certain surplus will lead to only getting fat or some variation of the previous ideas. the fact that people suggest it in this sub in particular is strange to me. we are not the regular population. many of u here are underweight or very skinny. the purpose of this post is to hopefully demonstrate that the previously mentioned idea are a bit silly especially for the population of individual who find themselves in this sub. there is a lot more to gaining weight than just muscle or fat. by trying to gain with the specific idea of limiting your fat gain you are ultimately limiting your gains. mythicalstrength talk a lot about this and is far more knowledgeable in this field than i am so i will leave the specific of that discussion to him. in particular his thought about having training drive nutrition and not the other way around wa very eye opening for me. you can read some of his thought here i just completed deep water beginner and intermediate. i put on lb in week during beginner and lb overall in the week of beginner and intermediate. here is v lb that program is hard and i had to eat a ridiculous for me quantity of food to keep up. there wa no other option. eat or fail the program. this is higher than the rate of gain i see a lot of you striving for. yes i got a little bit fatter but i also got a whole lot bigger. i am year old. i am not an enhanced athlete. there is quite literally nothing special about me when it come to fitness. im just a dude with a job who started training in his s. let the difficulty of your training dictate your diet. if you get a little bit fatter at the end so be it. remember losing weight is easy for people us. its our default why losing fat be any different just for fun here what i looked before i started training compared to now v lb i hope you all see many gain in your future.

1388,0,my thought on appetite... ive seen a lot of people posting on here about lack of appetite recently or how theyre not hungry and it stopping them from eating. appetite is a lot motivation. some day youll have bucket load of it other time itll be nonexistent. that doesnt mean you eat. if i relied on motivation to hit the gym id skip most of my workouts. i very rarely feel i want to workout. however i that i to and so i do. once i start i suddenly remember how fucking good it feels. if i skipped out on my job every time i didnt feel working id never earn a paycheck. the same applies to eating. make it your job. it doesnt matter if youre not hungry it doesnt matter if you have no appetite. you biology doe not give a shit. we can all use appetite a an excuse. we can also say i feel going to the gym today but you wont see any results. at some point you have to face the truth. if you want to get big it going to be uncomfortable. there are going to be day where you want to eat feel training. if you allow yourself to submit to those feeling you will never reach your goals. this isnt easy. if it were easy everyone be big. fuck your feelings. ignore your appetite. use your logic. eat big to get big. treat lifting and eating a job. it is that to be done regardless of how you feel. get over that hurdle enter that mindset and nothing will stop you. too many people are on here for a shortcut the easy path the quick way to being the biggest motherfucker in the room. there isnt one. this journey is simple but not easy. how bad do you want it

1394,0,lean bulking is worth it i it tempting to go the dirty bulk route and try to shovel calorie in your body a day to gain fast. however just that most of this weight gain is gonna be fat. now for some people this isnt a big deal. but for me i really do want to limit my fat gain and stay relatively shredded. ive been working out consistently for a year now. ive gained twenty pounds. i went from pound to pound eating calorie a day. im obviously still skinny but i this is solid progress. my waist is still inch even after twenty pound gained. now the kicker is that even though ive gained only twenty pound ive started receiving ton of comment from people. its obviously helped my self esteem immensely. strength gain are solid a well given the slow weight gain. i just pulled a pound deadlift for the first time which i am very happy about. im excited to keep going and see my future progress. i just wanted to say that it is possible to gain weight and build your physique without excess fat gain. its just gonna take time. you have to be patient but it is worth it.

1480,1,when to start overcomplicating your training aka. periodisation st tldr only start it after you cant progress anymore and have a lot of time on your hand. i have been there. not getting any better for months. a periodised program be a good idea if you are not making progress. i how good your training knowledge or current training plan is right now though so take what i say with a grain of salt. video explaining periodisation i only start complicating your training with periodisation after you make any progress after week or more. so begin tracking your exercise that you are currently doing. retest your max after or so week and if you havent improved then it time for complicating your training. on which kind of program are you rn btw if you are just training randomly then the next step be to have a consistent routine then to track your rep and set and then linear periodisation easiest to track and to progress a a beginner only after not progressing from a linear program should you consider to complicate it further. linear periodisation basically mean a structured program in which you are planning to improve rep or weight most commonly so i really consider it periodisation because you are able to make a uncomplicated suited for beginner routine with linear. why not begin with linear then answer you very well could but it take consistency and effort which most beginner have yet developed. for the normal guygirl whose main focus in life isnt to get better at calisthenics it is way better to focus on consistency first. so when you are starting out do what is fun for you progress will be automatic if you havent trained before. focus on consistency that mean make working out a lifelong habitdoing a little bit every day or consistently working out time a week if you are low on time is a great way to start a a beginner. i have been training for year now mainly the basic compound pushup pullups row and pike pushup those are great exercise to start withpushups and row are the that everybody should do imo feel free to disagree i tried periodisation but it take a lot of time effort knowledge and it wasnt worth it for me. i am just gonna stick to the basics. and spend a much time exercising a my motivation and life allows me to. i still prioritize consistency over everything bc if you are not training no perfect training plan is gonna be more beneficial than you training but only doing set of row and set of pushup when you feel it aiming for a few time a week this is how i deal with low motivation still training. nd tldr periodisation may be a great way to progress but only start periodisation after you cant progress anymore. periodisation is a lot of work. consistency is always king.

1610,1,for people starting bodyweight training men woman please read the whole post before leaving any good or bad opinions. so i have seen a lot of post on here about how to start off what equipment to buy or how to structure a program with very little to no exercising experience so here is a little but i really hope you read through this whole thing. first of all...you have to be realistic here you equipment a dip bar and a pullup bar or a dip station with pull up bar or gymnastic rings yes even a a beginner you can use them i because ive helped a few friend using only ring if you want to make the best gaines possible. i personally have a standing pull up bar and ring attached to it and it really good now im not saying you cant make some gaines without the equipment starting out but it is recommended to have or atleast one piece of equipment get the ring in my opinion so save up or do if you really want to make the best progress possible because id be lying to you and so is everyone that say you really equipment to workout bro just do push ups every day and some ab workout i wa told that crap when i first started my fitness journey and it wa hella discouraging when i couldnt even do push up consecutively or never saw the result i wanted. now sometimes park have a pull up bar or even calisthenics equipment so you can also try that equipment ive usedrecommend you can get the equipment i recommended earlier on amazon but if you decide to buy ring try to buy them with the longest strap possible and the biggest ring size it just make the ring more useful and comfortable in my opinion but it not a must if you want to. now for the good stuff you might have seen me recommend these youtubers austin dunham and brendan meyers on a few other post but thats because i used to watch them when i first started my calisthenics journey and their program really helped me out a lot especially brandan meyers body evo program which wa the first program ive ever bought and saved up for when i wa and i regret it till this day. so what im going to do is share that program and austins for you guy to enjoy and kick start your journey and use it a a foundation for future program that you may want to build later on your own but if you choose to go another route or do your own research thats fine but i honestly recommend these program a a foundation because now i make my own program but every once in awhile ill reference back to these program just for fun. links to the program a little ring program from daniel vadnal for yall i recommend downloading the program on your computer with an ad blocker and if you want you can even scan it with an antivirus if youre a little skeptical but youll be fine downloading it normally. this is really important. when choosing a program or buying one on your own for the love of god stick to it follow it to the t unless you have to substitute an exercise because you cant physically do it or have the equipment and deviate from it youd be surprised how many people will buy or use these program and not stick to them and complain about not seeing result because they decided to only try it out for a week maybe. thats not how thing work good thing come easily. lastly i just want to say that no i everything there is to working out i am learning just a much a you are but from the little that i have been able to learn through these few year i sure do wish i knew it then. and quit it will be hard it will be tough it going to challenge you but you have already taken the first step to changing your life in a way you even yet and you have a whole community thats here to support you and if no one believes in you at least you i do. you for taking the time to read this and i hope it at least one of you disclaimer i just want to say that i am not a physician or a doctor or anything that all of this is from personal experience and people i have trained with and have personally trained thats all.

1655,1,is this workout routine alright there im new to fitness. i started working out about week ago. so far all my strength number have been going up and ive noticed some size gains. all ha been well and good to my knowledge.. however i wanted to write out my routine and ask if there anything more i could be doing even with the success so far im worried that ill learn later on that i did wrong and left potential strength gain and muscle growth on the table. so with that being said here we go. ive been running a pushpulllegs split hitting each day twice a week. sunday rest. i should also note i rest minute between set but i alternate the exercise back and forth. for example ill do set of ohp rest min and do set of tricep pushdowns rest min and go back to ohp rest and so on until i get set of each so overhead press for reps. rest min tricep pushdowns for rep rest min overhead press for reps. rest min tricep pushdowns for rep rest min overhead press for reps. rest min tricep pushdowns for rep rest min overhead press for reps. rest min tricep pushdowns for rep rest min for push . set overhead press set tricep pushdowns . set of bench press set of lateral raises ive been using restpause to grind out some extra rep on lateral raises . set of weighted ring dips set of skullcrushers for pull . set weighted ring pull ups set facepulls . set of dumbbell curls set of shrugs . set of ring rows set of lat pull down for legs . set barbell squats set nordic curls not super great at these yet . set of romanian deadlift set of calf raises . set of bulgarian split squat set of barbell hip thrusts and thats it i also hit ab everyday with round circuit of ab roll out crunch and hanging leg raises. for the set that say i usually take those rep short of failure. and once i get set of i increase the weight. and the set that are i take those to failure until i can get on all set before i increase weight. with that being said let me what i can fix what you if it good if it not. or if this is one of those if it aint broke situations. haha let me and you for any info you can provide

1726,1,why do ab workout burn so much compared to others when i do ab workout i have to stop based on pain and burning of my ab muscle but not in the same way a other muscles. for example if i do pushup to failure i literally cannot do the movement from pure muscle fatigue. my muscle just will not do the work and it impossible to lift myself up but not from a sensation of pain or burning. my muscle just will not do it. but when i do ab exercise i have to stop just from the sheer burning sensation but seems if id be able to push through that pain id be able to continue for longer. i also feel i cant breathe well and have to take conscious deep breath after i stop to relieve the pain in my ab before i can continue again. why is there such a big difference here in the experience of muscle fatigue and is what im experiencing normal is it safe to try to try mental conditioning to push through that pain to try to prolong the exercise

1747,1,absolute beginner. doing ck but thinking of adding bwf primer. worried about losing out on potential gain i finished my first week of ck. i will start week tomorrow but i wa thinking of adding in the primer. my concern is the following despite finishing the first week of ck i i have a good cardio base. after every run i feel completely destroyed gasping for water though slightly le so with every run i take. despite the fact that i feel good after a couple of bodyweight exercise a massage you do on yourself i worry that if i do the exercise on the day im not running because of my couch potatolevel cardio stamen and physique i could be disrupting any potential gain by not resting. should i a finish the ck to week the final week first and then start on bwfp primer. in this case i make my schedule one of the following . m bwfp t cardio w bwfp t cardio f bwfp s rest s rest . m bwfp cardio t rest w bwfp cardio t rest f bwfp s rest s rest b start implementing bwfp now with the bw cardio schedule in the rbwf faq. any thought and suggestion are appreciated.
1748,1,pain in my left shoulder on push day. m kg cm 
1749,1,i made an app to track individual muscle training frequency and training volume ive used a multitude of workout tracking apps for my gymnastics ring training a well a tradition gym training the first one i got worked okay for about month but then one day all my data wa just gone. next i used strong and i still use it to this day to track every workout but the only shortcoming is that i found myself getting so involved in the detail of every rep set and exercise that it wa hard to focus on the bigger picture training each muscle frequently and with adequate training volume specifically i wanted to make sure i trained each muscle at least twice per week with a certain amount of set for each muscle group. at first i just used a spreadsheet but after a few week i kept thinking that it just wasnt very convenient or user to have to open a spreadsheet tap to open the keyboard type in dismiss keyboard and repeat for each muscle group a i trained i wanted that wouldnt distract me from my workout because tracking my set and rep in strong wa already enough of a distraction. so i made built training log much entirely to solve my own problem however i now see that it could be of use to much more people. link ctbodyweightfitnessampmt its basically a grid of state button with muscle or exercise on the y axis and the day of the week a the x axis with a set column on the end to make sure you get enough training volume. first you plan out your week by tapping all the muscle exercise you want to do on each day then during your workout all you have to do is tap to fill in the planned block after youve completed all set for each muscle group exercise. tracking my training ha been a breeze ever since i finished this app so i hope others find it just a useful a i do. not sure if this is against the rule or not just wanted to share this because i it could make a lot of people life easier when it come to tracking workouts.

1805,1,has here returned back to weightlifting since the pandemic ended what do you about body weight fitness v weight lifting now before the pandemic i did not work out. during the pandemic i wanted to get fit and started body weight fitness also used bands. i made definite progress in the hypertrophy department but eventually hit a peak. i ended up buying a squat rack for my home and started lifting weights. of course i made a lot more progress in the hypertrophy department this way. i have navigated away from body weight fitness and exclusively do weightlifting. the sole reason i have is that i get more hypertrophy result faster with weight lifting. i i could have continued to do both but the novelty of exercising ha kind of gone away so i just want to minimize the time i spend on it. how about you guy have any of you returned to weight lifting since the pandemic ended do you continue to do body weight fitness or have you quit what are your thought on body weight fitness v weight lifting now after having extensive time doing both do you prefer one for certain result and prefer the other for different result

1816,1, 
1817,1,whats everyones thought on bracing inwards v outwards as a lot of u have no doubt seen there wa a big drive on bracing inwards or exhaling completely whilst ab training to avoid bread loaf abs. personally ive found that if i spend a good amount of time fully expanding my belly or bracing outwards i actually have this great core activation especially the obliques. i get why you to exhale to get a great flexion and crunch of the rectus abdominis but could some of u to train our ab in more of an extended position exhale flexion and crunch definitely train the abs. but could an inhale and brace train the ab in a more functional way especially for those with poor posture. anecdotally dedicated ab workout with more flexion based exercise and that cinched aesthetic after make me feel a lot le stable than bracing and non cinched ab workouts. feel i subconsciously tighten my stomach in everyday life which restricts my breathing. spending half hour focusing on expansion and tensing my ab definitely my posture. those that subconsciously hold in their stomach are likely compensating for a weak overall core ie weak glute or hamstring at the base of the core. lower ab and stomach tightens inwards to compensate restricts the diaphragm from moving optimally therefore this laboured shallow and rapid chest breathing that many of u have. keen to hear people thought

1833,1,how do i deal with psychological exhaustion and hatred of exercise minute ago i started doing my leg workout. i finished the first set took a break and went to do the second set. i wa doing pistol squat on my left leg when my brain simply had too much of it. i lowered myself for the th rep said fuck it and quit. i didnt quit because my muscle were burning or achieved failure. i gave up because i wa tired psychologically. for the past two week my rapid progress in all of my leg exercise ha finally stopped. i couldnt progressively overload myself for leg workout in a row i do ppl split. you have no idea how much dread and fear i experience before the leg day. im afraid of the pain im going to suffer. im afraid of the discomfort and occasional burning feeling in my muscles. im afraid of regressing or not being able to hit the prescribed amount of repetitions. i waste my evening trying to find a solution to this issue to discover someone who ha had the same problem and fixed it. additionally ive been seriously considering taking a full week off training. the last time i did that that wa one year ago for leg and six month ago for arms. im sure that if i make my training more enjoyable i risk quitting all of this altogether. can you me it be the right thing to take a small break do you perceive the same emotion a i do before a gruelling workout p.s. ive been training since the age of im now. i can probably count on my finger how many time ive missed a workout in the last three years. my primary goal is muscular hypertrophy with a bit of strength endurance.

1837,1,going into a dead hang on weighed pullups so ive recently been training weighted pullups and im curious about what i should be doing. with normal pullups i always start from a dead hang explode up hold at the top for a second and then lower slowly back into a dead hang then repeat. ive had no issue doing them this and will probably continue this way for unweighted pullups. now for weighted pullups i want to train these for max strength so sub reps. i wa unsure a to how to do the rep. of course i will start in a dead hang but when lowering is it safe to go into a dead hang with external load or i be safer lowering until my arm are extended but while still maintaining scapular depression in an active hang. this is how i currently perform them. of course i to go back into a dead hang and pull from there i do with unweighted pullups however my main concern is that over time will this damage my joint or the structure in my shoulder or elbow etc any helpadvice regarding this is much appreciated

1840,1,small protip for additional bicepcore work hold the top of the chinup. one of my overall issue with bwf is what i feel is a lack of bicep work. after trying out some curl following a set of chinups to failure it became very clear to me that for the purpose of aesthetic bar work alone wouldnt be enough. im now doing a little extra on the final or nearfinal rep of my narrowgrip chinups i stopped doing pullups a long while back i hold my position well above the bar. in doing this i feel a clear emphasis on bicepscore putting in more work and a a result i wa not able to do a many curl afterwards. just a small to try in your routine.
1841,1,is set of pushup while doing max rep per set till exhaustion too much every day so for set each are different variety of pushup diamond wide etc then the seventh and th set i start the cycle over again for another variety. each set consists of maxed out rep till exhaustion. so my is is set too much i do these everyday. but im at what point will it become more muscle endurance than actually building muscle which is what im actually after. the reason i do set is because on the th set my triceps are dead but my chest is not that worked. but by the th set i can feel my chest is worked but my triceps are completely spent and feel theyre going to blow up. but i mean i want to get both equally spent so what to do here..

1848,1,should i change the order of my exercise hello everyone i started working out a couple of month ago at home training in a ppl routine day a week. on push day i do set of pushup of them with added weight in a backpack followed up by set db press set of flys set of ohp and set of triceps dips. first of i wanted to ask if this is enough to build muscle i do this workout x a week. im a beginner weight kg at cm. male my problem i noticed that my db press really suffers when i do it after the pushup i can almost double the rep if i do db press first but if i do it first im barely able to do pushups afterwards no weighted pushups. for building muscle should i do the db press or pushup first does it even matter or am i allowed to switch up the order based on my liking on that day i hope it okay im asking this here because im including dumbbells sorry if this is dumb and im just overthinking i just feel there is so many thing that can ruin your gain according to youtube litteraly drive me crazy. you for every bit of and greeting from germany
1849,1,decline pushup instead of regular pushup hello i have a  i train calisthenics for year now i wa training with weight in the gym before. i train for skill but for hypertrophystrenght so im progressing by adding weight. i follow ppl split and i personally le exercise with higher volume so variation of vertical pull variation of horizontal etc.. same for my pushday i do x dip and x pushups. the thing is a i said i train mainly for hypertrophy so with just dip and regular pushup i will definitely grow good chest but im just missing those incline bench from gym for upper chest i mean every muscle building program ha incline pushing. with calisthenics for upper chest pushing there are decline pushups. some people say it upper chest exercise incline dumbell press for example some say it harder variation of regular pushup some say they completely suck because shoulder and triceps are heavily activated and you get almost simillar upper chest activation with regular pushups. i tried them and i feel they are more compound and just le isolating than incline press but they are still target that upper chest little bit more than regular pushup i guess. so my is do you i can do dipsdecline pushup on push day could i do decline pushup completely instead of regular one or the upper chest activation is not that big with decline a i will be better with sticking to regular pushup what do you 
1850,1, on rbodyweightfitness apps hello ampxb im going back to bodyweight fitness and this sub after a few years. i am using the old android app that is also featured in the faq. in it there is the recommended routine and two extra flexibilitycare routine and i had a few is the inapp recommended routine equivalent to the one in the section routines i see the old one in the app with bodyline drill into the progression handstand instead of the newer pair and the tripet approach. where can i find the video for the stretching routine of the app the video wont open when i click it open youtube but no video is selected and overall you use another app or routine what i of the app is that it track progress so id to pick an option that is maintained or ha continuity otherwise it doesnt make much sense. ampxb you

1852,1,which is the best pike pushup form me trying to replicate the different form of pike pushup that im talking about there this is kind of an exploratorydebate post where i to have your opinion and experience on the topic of pike pushup form. my main intent behind this post is to understand which approach is best for strength gain and transferability towards skill hspu and bentarm presses. every single tutorial on the pike pushup ha a slightly different approach and give different form cue even when leaving aside the plain bad one wrt calisthenics transferability at least elbow flared outhead touching the ground between the handspurely vertical plane of motion a in this picture clientfirefoxbdampsourcelnmsamptbmischampsaxampvedahukewjjtjcjahuwqeeahqmbfuqauoaxoecaeqawampbiwampbihampdprimgrcmqjgbmgoivnm. even among the main wellrecognized calisthenics influencers there are significant disparity on the topic of pike pushups. the different form i there are mainly approach although there is a whole spectrum between these two extremes. these approach seem to agree on what the toppart of the rom should be elevating the shoulder a much a possible tucking the head between the shoulder a shown in picture a but differ in the lower part of the rom. the first one depicted in picture b advocate for a diagonal movement where the goal is to touch the ground with the nose very far forward in front the hand in order to increase the rom. this is the form promoted for instance by antranik in this detailed post with this form it is considered that some arching in the back is ok since it be very hard to maintain a perfect posterior pelvic tilt and hollow body in this position. the second one depicted in picture c advocate for a movement that is closer to vertical where the goal is to lower the head until the forehead or top of the head touch the ground and form a equilateral triangle with the hands. examples of influencers promoting this technique are fitnessfaqs for instance in this video from on saturnomovement in this video tom merrick here from a particular emphasis is placed on maintaining a posterior pelvic tilt and preventing any kind of arching in the back. another cue that is given in some of these video is to purposefully shift a much of your weight a possible on your hand from the very beginning of the motion only tipping a lightly a possible on your toes. an example of an inbetween approach be that proposed by yaad mohammad in this video from on he touch the ground with his nose but not too far forward and insists on keeping a hollow body which i tried to replicate in picture d. my experience ive experimented with these different form in the past several month on the grind for the frogtohandstand and my feeling so far ha been the following i found the second more vertical form noticeably harder than the first one with all other parameter equal elevation of the foot distance from foot to hand and felt a stronger load on my shoulder whereas i feel the first form somewhat offloads the shoulder in favor of the upper pecs in the lower range of motion probably due to it slight resemblance to pseudoplanche pushups. ive noticed that trying to touch the ground with my nose instead of my forehead induces some arching in my back which seems to make the movement a bit easier a well despite the increased rom. in my experience the shift your weight on your hand cue make the exercise significantly harder and when your foot are close enough to your hand they should almost be able to lift off the ground when at the bottom of the rom. im still not anywhere close to getting a full hspu or bentarm press so i didnt want to draw conclusion based on my experience alone. which is why i to hear your opinion what is your opinion . which form ha the best carryover to skill handstand pushup and bentarm press . from an anatomicalbiomechanical perspective what make the second form harder than the first one ps i that this post is kindof nitpicking and that just getting the rep in is more important than debating endlessly about form but still i really learning more about the theory and the anatomybiomechanics around calisthenics

1859,1,splitting the rr into a ul split guy one thing ive noticed is that i have horrible consistency with working out only x a week plus i never liked how long the workout take. ive been going gym x weekly doing a ppl weightlifting split for the past week to see how id feel and i love it. its much easier for me to stay consistent when i go for shorter period essentially everyday. i already miss doing majority bwf ive still been doing pushup dip pullups etc so im what be a good routine to follow or a good way to split the rr so i can be in the gym day a week granted i should be hitting the same volume a x a week fullbody correct

1861,1,is it possible to achieve this kind of physique meaning this level of muscle mass only with bodyweight excercises mainly push ups dip pull ups row none of them weighted i wa if it possible to achieve a look that with bodyweight excercises and i mean without performing them weighted but just bodyweight more a prison workout. of course in this particular case a clean diet is essential im aware of that. all in all he seems to have a good chest decent arm and possibly a lagging back so my main doubt is that dip and push ups can give you that kind of chest. i wa thinking of that chest push ups incline wide ring pushup dip ring fly back pull ups regular neutral wide chin ups narrow chin ups row regular row wide row ring row shoulders already working with pull ups push ups and dips. maybe lateral raise and facepulls arms already working with chest and back excercises. maybe ring curl and diamond push ups once a week legs squat deadlifts pistol squat abs various excercises i want to be any bigger than that. do you it possible or should i add weighted stuff maybe only a regard chest

1881,1,are full range pullups the only true pullups so i wa talking to my brother about how i can do pullups in a row with good form and he wa telling me it doesnt count since i have to go down to a hang then back up. i honestly feel thats b but it is a challenge im ready to achieve. if you can just tell me your thought on this id really appreciate it. i google it up and these are the definition for both of them pullup an exercise involving raising oneself with one arm by pulling up against a horizontal bar fixed above one head. full range pullup when you do pull ups you should always aim for a full range of motion. do not only use the upper or lower part of the movement and go into full extension of your arm at the bottom but on the contrary you keep your shoulderblades pulled down.

1890,1,questions about weighted bodyweight exercises.. so ive come across some post where people have mentioned doing weighted push ups pull ups dip etc. i wa going to try this out but i am a little confused a to how you when to switch from just your bodyweight to added weight is there a magic setrep number that you reach and if there is how do you what that number be for example if i can do set of push ups without fail.. someone might say to add weight. so my other be what be the difference between adding a few more push ups to each set v adding weight is the addition of weight for the sake of timeefficiency or could you get the same result by adding more rep im not against the idea just for better information on it is all.

1950,1,my year old mom want to start exercising slowly where to begin my mom just turned shes still healthy and walk atleast minute day a week walk home from work every day. and sometimes longer walk on the weekends. she is not obese or severely overweight just some extra lb and some excess belly fat which obviously not great. and she ha not lifted weight ever or had any form of resistance training in many many years. she ha gained some weight in the last few year and to lose some. ive calculated her macro and will her plan her meal and learn to count calorie somewhat a i am still living at home for another month before going to uni after the summer ill make sure she get some more protein aswell hopefully i can get her started abit while im still at home. she asked me for tip or if we could start slowly every weekend with some bodyweight exercise together both for health and for bonding time. i am not quite sure where to start before doing any added weight ill tell her the importance that we go get a clear from a doctor first which i recomend at any age. i assume some cardio and the regular push pull and leghinge exercise is beneficial at any age pushup starting easy against a table or wall. maybe getting up from a chair in the start and transitioning into squatslunges and maybe some row movement other than that i wa thinking some yoga or just light stretching. but i really love some tip or guidance from with more experience i only started exercising regularly a couple year ago myself but have been doing well myself however i am in my s and i assume it quite different i have built a mini gym at home during covid we have access to dumbells a barbell squatting rack bench resistance band pilate ball and yoga mat and a pull up bar. is there anything i should avoid or any sign that we should move onto and some thing to keep in mind soreness not going away after a few day you in advance
1951,1,reps or sets ive been doing casual calisthenics for a while now almost a year but i came to a point where im no longer able to progressively do more reps. with chinups for example i do an allin first set then my second and third set have half of the first set in term of rep and my fourth one is basically just hanging on the bar. and since month ago or so i noticed that my progress ha been really really slow almost unable to get rep in the first set even after that long. that lead me to what might be wrong and considering that my diet is not that bad and i really try my best in each workout i thought it may be happening because i focus too much in the first set so it be better if i even out my set and do the same amount of rep in each one

1961,1,unequal leg strength all ive been training calisthenics for about month now around on some version of the rr currently doing upperlower split so i can do more leg volume but i still generally do on each a week. ive been working pistol squat for about a month now and im noticing a significant strength imbalance between my two leg on these. for example i can do unassisted or maybe very light assistance towards the end on my left leg. on my right i can do maybe one unassisted on the first set but much all subsequent repssets i at least a partial assist to get back up from the bottom. im not sure if it a mobilityankle strength issue maybe although i am able to hit full range of motion on both leg even if i cant get up from it unassisted on the right. i flexibility is a huge issue thoughive always been quite flexible. any helpsuggestions are much appreciated you
1962,1,is pushup a good way to slim up my arm 
1963,1,goals for this year i hope to keep training strength consistently. as a realistic goal im going to hold myself to at least two workout a week. i lead a really active lifestyle and have a weird work schedule so keeping a good workout schedule is difficult. ive not been too interested in skill work until recently. i it be a good motivator to try to finally get some cool skill down that ive neglected. this year i want to achieve a consistent press handstand. my main obstacle here is going to hamstring flexibility. ive always struggled so much with my flexibility. if i consistently stretch i literally cannot touch my toe or hold my leg straight out in front of me for instance in an lsit pull up which is an exercise i love but always do with knee bent. so minigoal is hamstring flexibility and megagoal is press handstand. i quite have the shoulder strength but i love pushing and getting that part of the skill will be fun for me. next skill goal is a full front lever. i can tuck front lever for around second at this point so i with consistent training here i can achieve a solid few second of full front lever by the end of the year. finally i really want to get a muscle up. i im really close here. i can bang out deep ring dip and chest to bar pull ups with good form well at this point. ive been trying to train the transition part of the muscle up but it really a crux move still. i i to get a stronger false grip so im going to focus on that. i may also be to purchase weight for my dip and pullups. have recommendation for product should i get a vest or a belt with plate anyway for reading. what are your goal for
1964,1,hollow body neck engagement ive been gym training for years. although my muscle are developed i feel a though my core is lacking which could be the cause of my shoulder and neck stiffnesstightness. tried doing the hollow body hold multiple time and especially when lifting off the ground i feel my neck back and leg work way more than my coreabs. if i try to lift my leg and upper body off the ground strictly using my abscore and nothing my leg slightly raise and my upper body doesnt budge. apologies for the long build up my is should my leg and upper body be completely relaxed during the hollow hold in advance

1966,1,chinup ladder are a cheat code. ill start this out by saying im an overthinker and my mind is usually the biggest obstacle to what i can lift. at the gym i wa able to do v bar chin but everytime i had to lift at home all i had wa a basic bar and i wa doing rep set that felt complete trash. right now i decided to try ladder etc didnt do them exactly a written very impatient person but rather just counted my rep a without letting go of the bar instead of counting normally. i just repped out set of it wa nothing. and to i wa honestly considering doing rows. if out there shuts down when they get to what their mind perceives a a hard set you have to try this shit probably even better if you do it with rest in between.
1967,1,different variation in the same day or in different day whats recommended for being proficient in the different variation of a given exercise for example there are pull ups typewriter pull ups archer pull ups weighted pull ups and so on. obviously weighted pull ups are a better version of non weighted pull ups for strength. but what about archer and typewriter how can incorporate them in my existing routine without making it longer or replacing other exercise should i do x weighted and x archer or typewriter or should i do set of weighted on monday and set of archer pull ups on wednesday the same applies to other exercise weighted dip or russian dips. what is the best combination
1968,1,the best setup for doing weighted pushup at home video to do this you a pair of straps. you can use martial art belts. i bought mine for bucks. if you have a plate loader you can just loop the strap through the weight plates. benefits of this setup allows you to go down a deep a you want. the weight hang directly below your upper back and chest. doesnt cause discomfort in your lower back. you can go extremely heavy without needing a spotter with a bench press. i have done rep with kg of plate hanging off me this. its definitely the best way to go heavy on chest at home.

1980,1,one arm pushup a a form of oblique training hello everyone my stats are a follows so that this post isnt m cm. and kglbs. ive been lifting weight for several year been following a structured routine for only the last . years. i can do bodyweight lb dip so i have a good amount of pushing strength and one arm pushup are not a challenge for my triceps or pecs. the discussion i want to start come from the observation that whenever i do onearm pushup i feel intense doms in my oblique the next day. this is obviously because of the intense strain on the oblique to prevent the body from twisting and collapsing during the movement. i havent felt this much strain on my oblique for any other movement despite training oblique consistently through other exercise such a woodchoppers windshield wiper and side planks. my is doe have experience with performing onearm pushup a an exercise to mainly train and induce hypertrophy in oblique or is there a similar bodyweight exercise that stress the oblique a much right now the only one that come to my mind apart from ridiculous move one arm front lever or planches is the human flag.

1985,1,my strength increased dramatically while being on calorie deficit so im a year old boy and ive been overweight for around years. i decided to lose weight since november and it been going decent so far. i wa cm ft and kg lb when i first started just plain overweight. and now im cm ft with kg lbs. until month ago i only cared about calorie in n out with extreme calorie a day. of course that led me to lose so much muscle and leaving me with a skinny fat look that i have now. i decided to just cut the calorie super low again and lose weightyes even muscle because i tried to maintainbuild muscle mass while losing fat at the same time and i found it really hard and just didnt work out for me. however yesterday i checked my rm of chinup cause i wa just curio about it. now i wasnt able to do a single chin up until i became kg lb which wa month ago. but yesterday i wa able to do full chin up while wearing a backpack filled with kg lb of stuff. i wa heavier than i ever wa with that backpack kg even heavier than before i started losing weight. but there could be just one lame answer to that. so a i mentioned before i tried to lose weight and build muscle at the same time with a reasonable calorie a day and also calisthenics strength training time a week. i did that about a month but there wa just no visible change. so doe that mean that month of proper workout increased my strength that much without any physical change but that wasnt the only workout i threw in since the whole weight loss started. i been doing pushup a day for month till last september but it hard to be called a proper workout. because i didnt anything about near failure rep set so ive just been doing some pushup throughout the whole day so i doubt that did anything to my strength. so if you the reason why i built strength while being on a crazy calorie deficit let me

1992,1,interesting discussion about fat make you fuller i wa just watching one of my nutrition lecture and i learned that for u to feel the sensation of being full and getting that satisfaction after eating leptin must be secreted for it to go to the hypothalamus and bind to the lepr receptors. our body only then recognises this a yep thats enough food. were good. i also learned that insulin stimulates both the synthesis and secretion of leptin. this ha the following implication we a rise in blood sugar so that insulin can get released gt secrete a fair amount of leptin gt feel full. on this idea my lecturer said that fat making u fuller come across a a misunderstanding for the most part. whilst it could keep you full after you feel the initial fullness but to actually feel full in the first place fat are actually counteractive. this is because fat slow the digestion rate of both protein and carbs ie. agent who are capable of spiking blood sugar and delay insulin secretion and therefore leptin secretion a well. and this led onto an important point for those following lchfketo approach for those who track their calorie and only just listen to their body having such high intake of fat very limited rise in blood sugar level they could actually put on weight because they have harder time feeling full after they eat this wa the main takeaway from the lecture though. any ideascounterargumentssupporting argument i this sub can be biased towards outshining the benefit whilst neglecting it downside but i always to evaluate the validity of my source even reliable one university lecture imo.

2016,1,dominik sky mentorship could be a scam first of all sorry for my shitty english. i want to share my experience with the so called sky mentorship from dominik sky and warn others of this potential scam. some time ago i found this sky mentorship on youtube and thought why not giving it a try. the mentorship wa supposed to be a personalized guide from experts. so i had an appointment with one of their staff lets call him james. cant remember his name. i it wasnt his real name anyway. we met in zoom and we talked for hour. first james wanted me to talk about my training experience and my current problem in calistenics. i explained my situation the typical plateau in everything and how my current routine look  after that james gave me an overview of their service. individual training routine why my routine wa trash and why i am stuck on this plateau. at the end he made an offer verbally. if id pay . i have gained access to all the thing he pointed out earlyer for life time. but due to their full schedule they couldnt offer individual support but access to all the knowledge dominik ha with videos. this have costed me only . but this offer wa a one time chance. also there wa only one chance. if i delince this offer they wont come in contact with me in the future. i had to decide in this moment. he gave me a link via zoom to the payment. . with paypal. all this made me because it seemed weird and here is why in my opinion the price is absurd. about it. where i life a normal gym membership with trainer and all the other stuff and staff cost per month. thats a bit more than year of membership if you summ it up to .k i had no valid information about getting my money back if i wont it. he said for one month i had guarantee. for sure... they use my personal training issue a bait. its a clever strategy to stick to the emotion to make them the victim taking the bite. reduce the price to make it a bit more comfortable. put pressure on the victim by the ultimatum of a limited offer. no real contract. just words. i didnt who i wa talking to. i had his voice and his fake name. they promised individual support but suddently they are busy and can only offer videos. for real there are enough video out there already. what doe dominik what others ampxb i didnt want to pay immediately because i wast convinced and needed some time to about it. so he gave me another appointment day later. thats not a thing they normally do he said again. but i got time to wrap it up and decide to not take the bite. so far i didnt find any information of other people that have tried the sky mentorship. im sure it a scam. if im wrong they a more serious way of selling stuff.

2074,1,any good workout websitesadvice today i wa for new workout on the internet and i came to a seemingly good article by mens health. however after a quick google search apparently it is not a good source of workout since apparently for recommendation from mens health evidence supported approximately of the recommendation while evidence wa unclear nonexistent or contradictory for approximately of the recommendations. i run into this situation a lot. one site say crunch are a good workout expert say they are garbage. another say situps are good expert also say they are garbage. surprisingly everybody seems to agree that plank are good although im sure in a few year they will be seen a garbage too. there is just so much conflicting information. so are there any good reliable site with workout that actually do either recommend site with workout that are actually effective site to avoid or workout that work for you. i trust the various workout community on more than i trust the workout site and the google experts. i workout for more or le every part of the body since i do not want muscle imbalance. my current beginner workout is squat and bicep curl for each arm with about pound of weight incline decline and normal pushup and then upper crunches. rest for min then repeat day a week. i i probably to up the intensity but i want to what to drop keep and add before i take it to the next level. i prefer workout that do not require use of equipment a i do not often have access.

2106,1,powerbuilding vs calesthenics i have a lot off experience with powerbuilding it wa my main workout source before corona. when everything closed i turned to calesthenics. with this i had a lot more progression in how i lookprobably also had to do with there being no parties. now back to today the gym is back open. now im twisted so much between the two that i asked myself if others blended them. first some personal pro and con pros calesthenics you train everything even small muscle stability in your wrist or grip strength. training session are usually much shorter with same exhaustion of the muscle afterwards how i felt it its cardio and strength training in one you do have more functional strength cons training chest is difficult because after dip exercise become more difficult in stability and schouder rotation strength then pure pec strength planche. leg training is also hard because when you reach pistol squats. the only good one are jumping squat and pistol squats. pros powerlifting with squat and deadlifts your posture is rock solid. which ha benefit for a lot off aspect in my life. you do get really strong and feel powerfull. but only on certain lift cons if you want to train everything you are busy for minute or more i often forgot wrist strength and now my wrist sometimes hurt when using them to much if you how to balance your workout you often have unbalanced physiquea lot off insecurity in self made program full body is also difficult because in a single workout you train every muscle but not a it should back only vertical or horizontal pull. one of the is missing also research on adding calesthenics in gym workout always lead to pure calesthenics not with added lift of the big . so i wa if any of you have a calisthenics workout with added big lift not a native english speaker.

2108,1,any workout recommendation basically i f if it matter have never worked out in my life other than for sport in school also when i wa very little i did hiphop but i havent done that since i wa and year ago i took fitness class for about month but thats it i really have a problem keeping up with more intense workout im not sure but everything ive tried i could do but im always afraid that im doing it wrong. i tried chloe ting workout a couple of time because a friend told me they are beginner level and i found them okay i could keep up but a lot of the exercise arent explained in detail and i have no idea if im doing them right. afterwards the day after i often get backpain. ive tried her workout multiple time because i really enjoy them and i really want to get into them especially the ab workout and it feel im not killing myself but im also doing  i want to loose weight im very happy with my body right now and i really want it to change id love to get ab maybe and id love to get slightly more toned but no big changes. the reason why i want to work out is because before the pandemic started i wa a very active person. im a terrible driver so id walk anywhere even if it a hour walk. now my class are online my work is online so that eliminates a lot of the walking. surprisingly i havent really gained weight but i also have a lot le appetite so maybe thats why. i just want to exercise because i feel very immobile and it making me unmotivated and sometimes depressed. im for exercise that substitute the everyday activity i used to have. nothing too intense and properly explained so i that im doing it right. sorry for the long description i felt it wa necessary to explain what exactly im for. if ive said that doesnt make much sense forgive me because i said im new to working out.

2133,1,study show chinups and wide grip pullups pose higher risk of shoulder impingement over shoulder width pullups scapula kinematics of pullup technique avoiding impingement risk with training change very interesting. ive always known and perhaps everyone here that wide grip pull ups are dangerous for the shoulders. what got me is how the chin up is riskier than normal pullups. i wa under the wrong impression that the external rotation from the chinup created more space in the shoulder complex thereby reducing the chance of shoulder impingement. i wa wrong. regular pull ups might be the way to go for with shoulder impingement and those who want to avoid it. how about neutral grip pull ups tldr high arm elevation during pullups reduces subacromial space and increase pressure increasing the risk of impingement injury. wide and reverse pullups demonstrate kinematics pattern linked with increased impingement risk.

2135,1,specific setrep scheme to increase pullups to preface i am not a bodyweight athlete. i am currently running sheikos powerlifting program but outside of weight i am a rock climber. that being said i find my pulling strength to be far weaker than my push strength when it come to bodyweight. when fresh i can usually get a set of pullups in with rep decreasing on the following sets. does have any specific routine i could follow at this level to increase rep i find gtg to be a bit too unstructured for myself and perhaps not even beneficial at the rep range i am at. id to get comfortable enough with pullups to be able to start working towards a muscle up.

2137,1,full planche in month will i make it so ive decided to go on a little journey called planche the last major obstacle before i can call myself an advanced calisthenic athlete. and ive given myself month to do it. this is where im currently at filmed end of december that wa about rpe . right now my balance give out before my strength doe cant even do a proper headstand for more than second another thing i will be working on but i fully understand that my shoulder chest and back strength is going to a massive upgrade to pull this off. so why month because thats what work best for me. i got my first iron cross after month of specific training. anything longer than that and i tend to burn out and regress so of a year for a strength training cycle is the best i can do. my month training cycle will go from being about strengthhypertrophy that it is now to about strengthhypertrophy doubling my strength training volume. basically ill be training a a power lifter. i will also be working heavily on the antagonist muscle to avoid postural imbalance which mean ill also be training heavy for front lever and pbar victorian but after i do my planche block in the training session. this will be the first time i share my calisthenic training journey with and i mainly wrote this post to hold myself accountable so no slacking off and maybe get some tip and support from you  ill be doing monthly update until month so stay tuned.
2138,1,brand new to working out 
2139,1,tips for getting back into groove post new born and extensive break so my wife and i had our first child last june. before then we have always been avid fitness people working out week. when covid hit we moved to bwf and followed the rr. we saw some amazing result from it and i fell in love with this style of working out. a year and a half later since starting the rr our baby finally came and i thought it be an awesome time for a break. the plan wa to take a month off and then get back at it. well a the old saying go the best laid plan of mouse and men often go astray. the first month came and went then then then now finally . before the baby i honestly cant remember the last time i went even a week without working out in some way and i definitely feel it. but trying to manage the balance of a kid and working out is.... challenging. aside from the fact i feel demotivated because i feel i lost alot of progress in that time. anyway im thinking about starting a split routine for easing back in and time constraints. probably the og split routine upper and lower. i guess im for encouragement motivation and on how best to get back to doing that i love.

2146,1,do i to isolate the supraspinatus 
2147,1,rotator cuff exercise alongside bouldering i tend to hurt my shoulder easily when bouldering especially on move and hold that put the shoulder in an uncomfortable position. i have not managed to isolate which exact muscle is the problem but ive noticed that move that demand strength while being in heavy shoulder internal rotation move that force a chicken wing arm position a well a some gastons often induce a sharp pain at the back of my shoulder which sometimes resorbs itself quickly and sometimes last for a few days. it feel a muscular issue more than tendon or ligament related so i suspect weakness in one or several muscle of the shoulder complex but im unsure which. here are a few photo of position that i reckon probably cause me discomfort or pain movebymanucornumunich.jpg the right arm position i do calisthenics besides bouldering and my upper body routine usually revolves around a few skill the basic chinups or pullups bodyweight row pushup or dip pike pushups. i consider my scapular stability to be good in the context of calisthenics and the only imbalance i have noticed is that i believe my overhead pressing strength pike pushup to be slightly lacking compared to the other movements. i have not done any dedicated rotator cuff training so far but i i may to start doing some to prevent more shoulder pain and potentially serious injury down the road. any idea what specific musclemovement pattern i to reinforce and some exercise to do so cc ueshlow a i you have a lot of experience in this domain and in climbing

2152,1,front lever row and scapular retraction i want to see what everyones opinion are on the front lever row for full range strength training specifically scapular retraction. i value the fl row due to it crossover to static fl and a a counterbalance to horizontal pushing work. but recently a ive been working on fixing some postural issue rounded shoulder scapular winging impingement ive noticed how the fl row doesnt allow full rom range of motion because it is almost impossible to properly retract at the bottom of the movement. my pull work much revolves exclusively around fl work and chinups. but neither of these movement build scapular retraction am i correct. so doe that mean that your average calisthenics pushpull program assuming mine is average is not effectively balanced since it never allows for full scapular retraction training love to hear your thought
2153,1,what the ideal push pull leg workout be with no equipment to start exercising again 
2154,1,training with a weighted vest. hello i am considering getting a weighted vest for a while now since i am not interested in building skill by performing more complex move and i only care about health aesthetic and strength. i have been training in calisthenics for a few month in a disciplined manner time a week decent quality training programme decent quality diet and a couple year in an undisciplined one low quality training programme week and occasionally month of not training due to low morale low quality diet. i believe that a weighted vest will offer more gain in all aspect and will achieve it in le time than pure bodyweight exercise however i want to be sure i am making the right choice and that it is worth it before acquiring one since they are costly. in case it matter my level a of now is this can perform consecutive push ups with good form can perform consecutive squat with good form can perform consecutive neutral grip pull ups with good form can perform consecutive sit ups with good form. so my are goodbest time to start using one right from the beginning v after youve gotten a level of familiarity with calisthenics. how many kilogram should one start with how many if someone is a beginner how many if someone is already a calisthenics athlete who want to advance his level your personal experience and choice with weighted calisthenics. any information is useful. in advance. in case youre why the fuck is this post so verbose he couldve described it faster... heres the answer there is an automoderator bot in this subreddit which unless you write a wellconstructed essay will remove your post for socalled lack of effort.

2202,1,weighted pullups 
2203,1,most optimal routine for muscle hypertrophy i apologize if this ha been asked before. i saw a post the other day asking about calisthenics v weight lifting for muscle hypertrophy and most seemed to say that weight lifting wa superior. my goal is to have my dream body aesthetically. through my research i have heard people state that their version of training hard is hour daily with maybe one rest day for the week. whether this is good or bad i but their body speaks for itself. no disrespect to anybody on this subreddit at all but i have seen a lot of body transformation from the recommended routine over the course of a year for so and i am personally not satisfied with the results. i can definitely see a positive change in all of them but i cant but that different routine or training harder in some way get better results. i did the recommended routine very consistently for a year a well with unsatisfying results. maybe it also come down to the fact that i bulked the whole time i feel im rambling now. my is still just simply this is there any way to improve the recommended routine effectiveness if you have access to weight aside from just doing weighted version of the exercise in the routine i am thinking of hiring a personal trainer or to me in this regard but i see how it be much different from consulting with a knowledgeable community yall. for reading and happy new year. tldr i have weights. are there better exercise to replace or add to the rr to increase it effectiveness or an entirely different routine be more effective even the faq implies that the rr is inferior to a routine you could cultivate with additional equipment and weights.

2215,1,bodyweight routine critiquesuggestions moving forward basic information m lb i started at lb and never done any sort of strength training a day in my life. always been more of a runner. i did push ups jumping jack and sit ups and cardio running janfeb this year to start dropping some weight. picked up a lot of stuff from bullyjuice on youtube on bodyweight exercise then created my own circuit based on a lot of the exercise i learned from his channel. i also do my fair share of running. bodyweight routine monwedfri ipad stopwatch to track times. chin ups about sec ankle taps sec rest s push ups good form about sec crunches sec rest s upright plank m steam engine sec rest s elbow plank m crunches s ankle taps s rest s this account for exactly minute altogether. i repeat this same circuit until i hit minutes. i use to do this for minute junedec but for the last few week have been feeling a bit weaker so toned it down a notch to minutes. after the minute i will still continue other set below chin ups rest s ankle taps m rest s push ups rest s steam engines s squats s rest s inverted rows dips i have a dip station i bought on amazon rest s ankle taps m rest s upright plank m rest s push ups rest s steam engines s squats s rest s inverted rows dips rest s just a variation of all this until i hit an hour or even a few minute after. i do this monwedfri except for fridays i only do min and a run after. mile run. pace depends on how i feel. easy pace is mph normal pace is mph moderate is and i sometimes do interval where i will do and mph. intervals vary. i typically run mile on tuesday typically faster pace mile on thursday typically a straight mph on friday interval speed saturdays i will normally do a really fast run at mph for min then sec slower at mph then back up to for another min until i hit miles. i usually will walk my dog monthurs mile at typically a mph pace. all in all i feel i am super active. i have a physically demanding job doing highway guardrail. some day are harder than others but i have yet to talk myself out of anyday of my routine. my diet i never payed any attention to until around july i took a break from bodyweight training from marchjune to try and drop weight faster so i did a lot more cardio during that time. ever since the second week in june my routine ha been strict. maybe missed maybe a day or since only to let fresh tattoo heal up. some day i will do bodyweight training and run immediately after i have a treadmill at home but i will always take a quick break and eat a bowl of oatmeal with walnut and a banana before i start my run a to try and avoid burning any sort of muscle. i also eat before i workout a well but that varies. typically greek yogurt. normally i have had breakfast lunch and snack during the day before i do my training so i worry much about eating before hand. if i do it maybe a scoop of pb and a greek yogurt. after i run my cooldown is typically walking the dog i mentioned earlier. right now im just a little torn on what id to do moving forward. personally id to go on a cut and drop more weight because i feel a if i picked up a fair amount of strength and muscle gain but am somewhat skinny fat so i feel i to get my bf lower so i can actually physically see how hard ive worked this year. am i getting enough rest time my workout feel intense that coupled with the running and walking im doing feel a lot. does the workout seem too much or not enough any commentssuggestionscritique welcome. i i did touch base too hard on my diet but if any of that detail im happy to provide some insight.

2231,1,restarting training some helpadvice. its been a while since i posted in this subreddit. but over the last month ive been recovering from an injury i sustained whilst playing football. after load of rehab im back to being able to play competitively although im probably at match fitness. in the time i did not calisthenics or any sort of resistance training. now since getting back to it and ive been doing the rr recommended routine for about week and ive progressed quickly and im back to doing weighed pull ups and weighted dips. over the time i wa not training i looked over my previous training and thought id change it up so i can learn to fl and planche in or at least get the fl by this time next year. i the planche is quite hard so that may take year at bare minimum. so im seeking some on programming and routine structure. i steve is planning to release an app sometime soon but in the meantime i some  my plan is to train towards my calisthenic goal about x a week with or session of leg per week depending on football training. so here is an outline of my plan after i do another two week of the rr. monday friday . warm up and mobility min . fl and planche statics . fl rows pppus . pull ups pike push ups wednesday . warm up and mobility min . fl and planche statics . fl raises tuck lsit to tuck planche . bicep isolation shouldertricep isolation one idea is too alternate each week which workout i do once or twice in that week.in the example above i do wednesdays workout on monday friday and take the former and do it on wednesday. changing it each week an alternative routine be to have a planche and fl day. monday and thursday . tuck planche hold second x . planche lean second x . tuck lsit to tuck planche x . pppus x . pike push ups x tuesday and friday . tuck front lever hold second x . . tuck front lever raises x . fl rows x . pull ups x . hollow body hold sec x andor bicep isolation another alternative instead of doing leg on a sperate day is to throw in a maximum of leg exercise at the end of each workout similar to how the rr ha squat and rdls. that way i can work on my planche and fl training whilst still making leg gain and leaving the other day to do more drilltechnique based training for my soccer or focussing on improving my mobility such a ankle mobility which is terrible. am i doing too much.
2232,1,how can i make a workout plan or what can i do to gain strength a a beginner 
2233,1, with mobility hello guy and a happy new year to everyone. so im just posting about with mobility. since i started calisthenics ive noticed i have very poor mobility which ha probably lead to some injuries. for example i cannot for the life of me sit in deep squat due to poor ankle mobility. when i do the inch wall test my knee is probably about inch away from touching the wall basically another inch of ankle mobility. in general im a stiff person especially in my lower body. i play quite a bit of soccer and i have noticed that i really struggle to hit high volley zidane ucl final cause of tight hip and i really struggle with the lsit cause of poor compression and possibly tight and weak hip flexors. so i wa are there any good mobility program out there that you recommend. i there are channel tom merrick on youtube but there is so much information out there that it a struggle to colate all of it and create a program that can me. theres even the kneesovertoes guy who program ive heard is good at helping people gain lower body mobility and strength. all opinionshelp is welcomed. and i hope you all have a great in regard to your fitness journey

2237,1,is implementing weightlifting exercices a bad idea for someone practicing climbing and running hello there im not sure if it the right sub to post this so feel free to redirect me. context im a yo guy been climbing for a few year but always seeked a balanced type of physique. thus i always end a climbing session with a full body workout and i run on my off days. i recently read overcoming gravity and became even more interested in balancing my workouts. this book answered a lot of regarding bodyweight fitness. however by doing a few spartan race i noticed not surprisingly that i struggled with weights. my leg shake a bit and i feel very confident in these obstacles. i of the spartan race a a recap of my overall fitness. so weighted obstacle being a big weakness i thought that maybe implementing a few weightlifting exercices into my routine me fill this gap. i wa thinking about deadlift bench and maybe squats. now by no mean do i want to be a world class climber break running record or become a strongman. i just want to be a balanced athlete with no big weakness that could lead to injury. weightlifting and bodyweight training a i see them are tool that could me reach that goal. so i wa at a gym earlier today this place ha a great boulder area a well a an area with multiple pull up bar and also a few cage for weightlifting. coaches there are either specialized in bodyweight training or weightlifting. i climbed a bit then went into a bodyweight workout and then a i felt still fresh asked a coach to me learn the technique for deadlifts since ive never done those. he basically said it wa useless for my practice and could even deteriorate my running and climbing game. hence the is implementing weightlifting exercices a bad idea for someone trying to be balanced

2261,1,gtg burpees x chin ups or pull ups challenge for the new year. for those who have the time here the deal. the burpees is one pump meaning. go to plank position do one push up. go to standing position and jump a high a you can. thats one rep. do this for second a fast a you can in good form. then go straight to do chin up or pull up. you mustnt go to failure. leave in the tank. then rest for a long a you  but do this x within the day. my suggestion is before and after each meal. you can spend one minute total doing this or less. so you end up with set easy. caveat. if you find you feel the performance diminished within the day where you cant do it a intense. stop. next day awaits. also if you cant do a burpee or chinups or pull up. go for knee raise push up and inverted rows. if you cant do any of these go for walking atleast minute before and after meals. that should net you hour of walking in a day. try to do this for atleast days. but take rest if you feel you should. and if you cant do it on a certain day because of work etc..its fine. but i do hope you take the challenge. this could be the workout youll be doing for the rest of your life. or atleast be a good foundation. tldr circuit variation pump burpee and pull up squat thrust push up and inverted row body weight squat push up inverted row knee raise and push ups walking you can also do your own circuit. but remember no going to failure. spread the set in the day. first sign of diminishing performance stop for the day.

2277,1,this will be in my new website about holistic health i love some input intense exercise including resistance exercise weight hiit calisthenics and cardio could be the best holistic health practice ever by a wide margin. unfortunately too many people do the intensity part. most people can build a lot of health strength this way. intense exercise is actually more efficient at triggering autophagy and apoptosis than fasting. there is definitely a too little and a too much when it come to intense exercise. see the section about hormesis. build gradually but be afraid of a little pain especially sore muscles. build your determination so that you celebrate when you get to an authentic failure when you simply cant push or pull any longer. sometimes when i fail doing pushup my arm are so tired and so weak that i have to roll over on my side and use my elbow to get up while chuckling to myself at what a victory that was. shy away from very long rest period during the day. the point of hiit high intensity interval training the best way to exercise is that you can put everything into your exercise. easy cardio is better than nothing but it doe not qualify a intense exercise. intensity is the secret. intense exercise is insanely good for one willpower about on par with cold showers. dr. peter attia md on joe rogan. peter tell u in this podcast that intense exercise is the single best drug for health and longevity. i actually spend very little time exercising. i guess that perhaps minute per day scattered all across the day. but those minute are down right heroic pushup in le than minutes. the rest of the time i am resting. without adequate recovery lot of people fail to progress. i cant tell you how many young people ive seen on youtube who complain that they arent getting the gain that they were hoping for when they do pushup or more every day. they arent giving themselves time to recover. if your muscle still hurt then rest. this isnt rocket science. it is being excessively yang pushing one self too hard and not allowing for recovery which is an inherently yin or parasympathetic process. no one should do intensity on the same muscle group day after day after day. every other day is quite sufficient. the new punishment for sloth is no longer eternal damnation. it is now painful disease and an early death. ampxb mike mutzel on fasting exercise and autophagy. does physical activity increase life expectancy a review of the literature dr. peter attia md on joe rogan. i that i listed it twice. i just want to make sure that people got the message.
2278,1,requesting routine critique guy i just wanted some critique on my routine made it myself. for reference im a year old male cm kg. my current goal is strength with hypertrophy a an added bonus i guess. my routine is structured so. four day of workout in a week with tuesday friday and saturday off. i do a straight arm bent arm split with leg work added onto straight arm days. workout sun wed warmup stretching minute skill work handstand and lsit to vsit progression back lever progression s s rest front lever progressiob s s rest planche progression s s rest anterior chain movement pistolshrimp squat rep s rest posterior chain movement deadlifts reverse nordic curl rep s rest workout mon thu warmup stretching minute skill work handstand and lsit to vsit progression one arm pull up progression rep s rest handstand pushup progression rep s rest muscle up progression rep s rest dip progression rep s rest front lever pull up progression rep s rest planche pushup progression rep s rest so i have a few regarding my routine selection do you i should have more training day in a week day split rest day rest days. or maybe even day a week should i have some focused core work in the routine i im hitting the core quite well with everything im doing but maybe add in some extra work if i am adding in core work should i reduce the load on the bent arm day by taking out one vertical pull and push movement so it becomes pair which then give room for the core work

2285,1,will pushup every day actually build muscle about year ago i didnt have access to a gym and naturally started bodyweight training. i wa that skinny asian kid and wanted to get big. so i started doing push ups every morning. i wa told it change my life. here are the result after month i started noticing some definition in my pecs. it wa a massive struggle reaching every day but i wasnt going to give up. after month my chest definitely looked visibly bigger but i wa actually surprised to see my arm and shoulder looked a lot bigger too. after month the workout became a lot easier and i couldnt believe how much stronger i had become. the speed of my upper body growth wa honestly insane to me. theres me thinking i needed a gym to get big so back to present day i decided to create my own version of a push up workout. it contains different push up variation targeting different part of your chest so i it better and more varied than just doing regular push ups. i honestly this will some people out there trying to build muscle for the first time. i it did for me. hope you find it helpful and love to get some feedback on the youtube channel too link to my video

2292,1,every time i start exercising my sleep get ruined. how can i fix this few day ago i posted here that im interested in starting a body weight routine and forward to starting soon. i got some satisfying answer but the there one thing i to figure out how to fix before i start. few month ago i went to the gym and started lifting again after not going for a year and a half. now note that ive always been a couch potato. constant gaming and film watching. year old ft fall btw. ive never been constant at the gym mostly because of college which i already graduated from. when i started lifting my sleep went to complete shit. i normally sleep to p.m. sometimes until . i strongly cherish my sleep mainly because in my late teen early s i struggled with sleeping. falling asleep ha never even an issue but staying asleep for hour was. i sleep at then wake up a or and couldnt fall back asleep for another hour leading to being late a work and such. thankfully now i have better sleeping habits. but when i started exercising i went back to that shitty sleeping habit.i worked out on a monday fell asleep at and woke up at . couldnt fall back asleep. at all. tuesday i work out again and it wa even worse cause i woke up at in the morning that night. felt complete shit so i didnt workout that day. and it that sleeping pattern continued until sunday. i stopped working out after tuesday but the sleeping pattern continued. its my body is so used to be fucking lazy that it rejected fucking exercising or  some have said it because i worked out in the evening but that wouldnt make sense because i said it continued even on day i didnt work out. monday night thing went back to normal thankfully and i havent exercised since. this happened to me last summer a well. what is the issue and how can i fix it im sure it some hormoneadrenaline thing because guess what when spider man no way home came out i wa fucking excited for the movie and anxious id be spoiled for it that i woke up at am and couldnt fall back asleep at all either. idk if it worth mentioning that.

2307,1, tried full body greasing the groove im curious if ha tried a greasing the groove style approach but for the whole body rather than just one exercise eg pull ups kettlebell squats dips. depending on how it go maybe add kettlebell swings in the future. i work from home have all the equipment i and have plenty of time on my hands. so i could easily do each exercise one per hour. i could even separate out the upper and lower body exercise eg pull ups kettlebell squats wait min dips kettlebell swings wait min repeat. id also do some light cardio after work just once a day taking rest day from this a needed. id say im currently at an intermediate level.
2308,1,greasing the groove saved me m post surgery. warning long read. so almost a year ago now i went into surgery for multiple injury to my bicep and shoulder. it all started a a result of a year old workplace injury but a time marched on it led to more issues. i got bicep tenodesis surgery shoulder labrum surgery and had my collar bone shaved so they could clean up my acl along with the bursa drained. frankly post surgery wa awful. ill save you those details. itll suffice to say when i wa cleared to start working out regularly after following my physical therapy to a t i did. but i wa so embarrassed at my strength. i left the gym one day and cried in my car because of how weak i became compared to others. i couldnt go back. the toughest part wa losing pull ups my favorite exercise. i majorly struggled with pull ups one because all that upper body strength wa gone but two because mentally i felt i couldnt start over again. and then a if a light bulb turned on i remembered greasing the groove. so thats what i did. i started hanging from the bar a few time a day. shit even that took work. then id attempt one pull up. then two. then three. then four. and so on. knowing i wasnt going anywhere near failure gave me the space to accept my weakness because i knew id just try again later. and it felt so easy so accessible that not only wa that mental block gone but the strength to do full pull ups bounced right back. i still have some issues. push ups are taking a long time to recover. and some exercise still feel funny. but without greasing the groove i if id ever have gotten the confidence back to justtry. so with that said  i where id be without such a simple concept. tldr gtg helped my recovery

2351,1,minimalists unite whats your minimalist routine im a firm believer of mental sustainability for longterm success so many people go through a beastmode phase of their life where they hit the gymworkouts hard to the max then ultimately just burnout. seeing an extended laundry list of movement in a routine is such a turnoff for me. considering the large of muscle compound movement hit i never felt it necessary to have such a long list. my own chinups narrowgriphollowbody. ive completely stopped doing pullups in favor of chins. at the very last rep of a set i hold at the very top to allow the bicepscore put in some extra work. try it these build some awesome abs. dips often with lb between the legs. its fun knowing that my pecs which ive been complimented on in a few occasion were built using my mom plastic medical walker. it sits in my room since it take up practically no space so i can crank out some rep on a complete whim convenient amazing. legs got me here. im lazy in this department. sometimes it goblet squat air squat bss. finally mastering the pistol squat so this may be my new lazy movement here in between my occasional hikes. etc kettlebells. walmart had some on the cheap earlier in the year so ill occasionally do a few cleansrows whatever. just some random spontaneous movement for functional strength building. thats much it. not the most exciting routine but it keep me consistent for sure.

2353,1,endurance training on off day this is a thats already been asked multiple time but with exercise that still feel you are doing strength or volume training rather than endurance. in my case id to train on off day just for the sake of increasing numbers. right now i can do about hspu per set today i checked and i can only do normal push ups which is not really that much compared to before i started doing calisthenics. with calisthenics my strength and hypertrophy gain are notorious but it seems i didnt improve in the endurance aspect. my primary goal is strength and progressing on calisthenics movement currently pursuing planche and front lever and endurance come second. so doing x rep of push ups on off day just for the sake of one day being able to do rep interfere with my current strength progress im an office worker i pas hrday in front of the computer and i really do any kind of exercise other than my strength routine time a week.

2377,1,weighted vest recommendation i recently quit weight training in favour of calisthenics a i found calisthenics to be far more responsive for me in term of hypertrophy i still exactly understand why this is. thing is i want to get a weighted vest because my strength is progressing quickly and the work is becoming too easy now. i to find a vest with a max load capacity of at least kg to give ample room for progressive overload. i got one of these high capacity weighted vest in the past but it tore at the seam and i had to send it back to the seller. so doe have any they can recommend very much in advance.
2378,1,how bad it is to do only pushing exercise in calisthenics it is often said that one should balance the training between pushing and pulling exercises. for example in steven lows book overcoming gravity it is stated the simplest method to maintain shoulder structural balance involves utilizing pull and push exercise which will offset one another. this will allow you to maintain a healthy balance of strength and hypertrophy at the shoulder. but what are exactly the consequence of an imbalance especially doing almost only pushing can it be a real issue or is it just a matter of preference or maybe this pushpull method is too simple and reality is more complex i it is a common imbalance a pushing exercise are easier to put in place they require no bar or equipment. it can be trained with the floor only.

2389,1,how to program for weighted pullups and pushup so just some info on me to begin with. cm kg and m. been training with the rr for almost a year now. went from pullups to solid rep on ring and from really poor pushup to pushup with solid form. im to start training with adding weight to these movements. but seeing a i have no experience with traditional strength training im not really sure how to program this. i wa thinking of doing a ppl split so that on each upper day i can focus all my energy into the weighted movement some accessories. i wa thinking this for the workouts. push weighted pushup db ohp some tricep isolation and additional shoulder work. lu raise and external rotation exercise pull weighted pullups. ring face pull ring row bicep curl some forearm isolation too. probably reverse wrist curl and finger curls. for rep and set i what to do for the accessories. its the weighted movement im unsure of. i plan on starting with kg on each movement and seeing how it feels. but beyond that im not sure. any be appreciated

2392,1, identifying and understanding safety and effectiveness of a loaded stretch i cant find anywhere. the exercise in is easiest to describe by picturing jesus christ in his last moments. just the the look of it not the feeling for obvious reasons. so i wa standing in the gym stretched between two cable machine facing each other cross over pull setup with my arm locked straight. it felt dead hang with arm pulled to the side. i wa able to do active hang a well a very limited range scapular pulls. i experimented for a while with amount of loaded weight to the point i had trouble getting hold of both cables. this morning i did a unilateral version on rings. so i laid on the floor on my side and grabbed a ring above and just hang on it doing sort of a hanging sideplank. i could do both passive hang and active hang and a little scapular motion a well and then i stopped abruptly in fear that this could be one of those moment of stupidity when one get injured and end up with a dislocated shoulder. so i wanted to see if any of you have experience with this stretch and if it any different than a dead hang or if it overlap too much or not safe enough to be worth considering. than you.

2398,1,shredded by september after surgery all hope everyone is having a great holiday. ive lurked here for a bit and have done a fair amount of my own research before starting the recommended routine. unfortunately right when i wa getting into it in the fall had a lot of time off while transitioning job i ruptured my achilles. recovery ha been slow and steady and i can put some weight on the leg now but i in general ill be taking sport or anything with explosive movement off the table for until i get the confidence in my agility back. id to get back into the recommended routine with the caveat being that even exercise that directly exercise the leg still involve it in some way getting up to or down from the pull up bar contact with ground for pushup etc. my main motivation is good for my wedding in september and of course being healthier in general. of course ill be talking to my physical therapist about ramping up my activity level but i wanted to see if this sub had any thought too a it generally seems to be one of the most helpful and supportive place i lurk on this website. i there will be an influx of seeking with the new year so any on getting back on this journey be truly appreciated happy new year to everyone
2399,1,bodyweight chest as a skinny dude ive always wanted a chest. despite that my priority in fitness are efficiency and convenience. i started in bodyweight by doing some pushup throughout the day. even after reaching high rep i noticed hardly any visible muscles. i tried diamond and other variation in hand placement. the minor change brought minor rewards. decline pushup could but the slight inversion deltoid requirement and variable in feethipshandhead placement kill the fun without enough chest reward. so i bought some strap and tried fly only to quit early for a few reasons. flys require straight arm strength to be effective while not necessarily helping to establish that strength. this mean i have to gain a capability that i quite value before i might be able to perform an isolated movement. secondly the rom for fly is absurd compared to other movement such a a pushup. the arm can either spread beyond their working limit or they can narrow to a point of imbalance. sure these are avoidable but again the cost is high for an isolated movement. lastly i see it a an ineffective attempt to replicate a gym machine so that more people buy straps. eventually i wandered into a gym routine and experimented with total body fitness. i decided to work on dip starting with bench then band at the dip station then varied positioning at the station. then i moved to the ring for support hold then negative then my first few shaky redfaced ring dips. with only a small volume those ring dip were grinding through my shoulder so i started warming up with shoulder dislocates. just fly the rom wa silly and the movement felt too isolated to be effective. everything changed when i started skin the cats. versus shoulder dislocates i wa getting a more effective warmup in a fraction of the time. if i focused on keeping my leg straight and slowing the movement then i also get some chest pump specifically when exiting the german hang. stc let me safely increase my ring dip volume. i wa mainly seeing tricep and stabilizer activation but not enough chest. i tried targeting my chest by leaning forward based on internet  however i felt no real difference and my form wa suffering. when i returned to strictly vertical form the depth in my range of motion began to increase. beyond rep at maximum depth hand to armpit my chest wa finally getting pumped. based on my personal experience i there is a common misunderstanding around the role of the pectorals. the lower pecs larger than the upper are used to move the elbow from behind the back to beside the ribs. both stc and fulldepth ring dip include this motion. by only working the lower pecs i wa effectively growing moobs. the space halfway between my collarbone and my nipple remained unfilled. i wa still happy to have but the longing for that complete chest persisted. for some upcoming travel i wanted a program that required le gear. without my beloved ring i needed for the upper body other than an excessive amount of gimmicky pushups. i prefer bodyweight fitness for mobility and a habit that can be independent of weights. without adding weight and without rom limitation wide variant bodyweight progression requires unilateral movement. i already use split squat and archer row so whats the unilateral variant of a travelfriendly upper body compound exercise i started doing archer pushup and i feel the same mental leap that came with stc and ring dips. archer pushup are difficult compound and they use a complete yet controlled rom. they hit my triceps hard while also hitting some back and shoulder due to the sidetoside motion which doe not exist for other pushups. the additional activation is because i can push or pull myself from one side to the other though i am still figuring out how to control whether the transition is more of a push or pull. focusing on that lateral motion make it difficult for me to hold the proper plank form causing a sag in the hips. i fixed this by piking slightly. i also learned to focus on pushing up and then over since a single push back to the center starting position caused more shoulder grind. one tricky cost v other pushup is a to rotate the palms. the shifting weight already add a more uncomfortable load to the heel of the hand that cannot be mitigated by using knuckle or finger tips. padding can with this but it should not add friction that impedes the palm rotation. ill be experimenting with some minor gear glove or paralletes. im also finding that a straight arm is more important than widening hand placement. widening caused more failure without actually increasing intensity. of course there is a required minimum width somewhere outside the shoulders. while i highly recommend archer pushup over any other pushup variant im still searching for how to complete that upper chest. thankfully there is another unilateral pushup variant called typewriter pushups. these feel harder than archer due to the persisted isometric load on the upper body. there is no rest between rep because there is no locking out. typewriters seem even le documented than archer so it unclear how far above the floor i should keep my chest. it to be somewhere between nipple scrape and lockout. im still new to typewriter but so far it seems that the ideal height is exactly midway. any lower and my shoulder start to grind. the lateral motion seems to be a shallow rainbow. after only a handful of typewriter in each set i can feel the upper chest activation that ive been searching for. time will tell if i see the visual balance. for now the feeling alone is exciting enough. i have any pic to share and hoping to see some moobs is a bit strange. anyways you for reading. id love to see more tip for bodyweight chest. tldr ring deep and unilateral pushups.
2400,1,my handstand struggle guy so a the title say i have been struggling with my handstand progress. i started a few month back and at first the progress wa coming really fast. the thing is i always only did chest to wall handstand a im terrified of the kickup which im aware is an issue. im probably an intermediate and strength is definitely not an issue however the balance is. at the beginning of my handstand training i basically measured how far my hand are from the wall everytime and progressed that way. after a while i got to a point where my hand are at about one hand away from the wall. since then i tried to improve my balance and get my foot away from the floor and i did a couple time for just seconds. sometimes i found the balance but immediately fell back because of fear of falling forward. lately i also feel im using way too much strength in the handstand and have zero balance and awareness. i cant seem to get my alignment right either. i feel a lot of preassure on my shoulder and im not sure if thats normal. i always do my handstand on the wall for second for set resting minute between. i do them after my warm up and before my push workout which i do twice per week. should i start practicing handstand more often i never did because after push session i always be sore and i feel it limit my handstand a lot. also it seems handstand are interrupting my hypertrophy workout which i mainly focus on. today i felt very weak after handstand and incline pike push ups were almost impossible with proper form. what is the fastest way to progress and get away from the wall how many time per week should i train the handstand since im focusing on hypertrophy training i will appreciate any tips.

2422,1,can someone explain to me the type of stress this put on your handsgrip when guy do horizantal torso on chin bar wo foot to stop rotation i can only get my brain around shoulder below hand type of hanging. thats the type of thing im used to doing with chin and pullups. i guess im not understanding why the hand spin around the bar when arm are at the angle this guy are in the pics. maybe im being lowiq about physic or as best i can of this by leaning backwards your centerofmass is no longer below your shoulder so where they go wouldnt matter and it doe look his navel is underneath the bar. so in theory maybe you to grip the bar at all ie just bend the first knuckle but not the rest to create antirotation one of those no hand pull wrist monstrosity but not quite so extreme but the stress is clearly different on the lat in some way because of the angle of the torso and i guess the leverage on the lat

2431,1,are sandbag lift enough to replace squat deadlifts to strength the whole posterior chain and leg if not then what do you suggest i plan to only use calisthenics for upper body a my goal is to attain the basic advanced exercise handstand push up planche push up front lever row one arm pull up and muscles ups. the reason for these move are that theyll stick with me and maintain strength to perform in any sport and life activity without reliance on external weight and keeping equipment minimal since at most the luxury of ring is a nice addition. as stated above one of my goal is to keep my equipment minimal at home in my studio apartment. i have a pull up bar ring parallettes and a lb strongman sandbag on the way. i also have a pair of olympic dumbbell handles but wanna try on them if i can just get the same strength gain benefit from sandbags and bodyweight. id to add that ill be joining mma bjj judo and other martial art facilities. if i ever further strength at a faster pace then ill use their weight assuming they have. as for the sandbag move to strengthen the muscle that deadlift and squat hit be sandbag shouldering. this mean my routine be the recommended routine for upper body and progressively moving up in weight with sandbag shouldering a my replacement for both the squat and deadlift. again the goal is to keep the daily routine minimal fast yet productive in preventing and reducing injury while developing the strength needed to handle plus pound and heavier to lb opponent a well a handle daily task kindly helping buddy move easily. i assume that if i can eventually shoulder a to lb sandbag for rep and set that ill have all the posterior chain and squat muscle strength needed to be equally or even stronger than those that use exclusively barbell dumbbell or kettlebells a their primary strength methods. so what is your experience knowledge and opinion on this approach of mine im open to positive criticism with helpful and suggestions.
2432,1,crossbench dips v hanging dips my friend and i have been having a competition on who is progressing faster and can do more weight with good form and midrange rep on weighted dips. i have been doing weighted hanging dip and he ha been doing weighted crossbench dip but im beginning to wonder the science behind which be easier to overload and by what degree. for example is me adding pound to my hanging weighted dip the equivalent of him having a plate on his lap pound weighted vest on a crossbench dip i cant find much information on this a it really doesnt matter much otherwise for lifting purposes.
2433,1,im getting nowhere with pullups but i really want to heya im a year old girl and i do circus stuff. im aiming to be able to do consecutive pullups within the next months. i have a pullup bar in a doorframe in my house but just training pullups doesnt seem to me at all even if i do them every day they seem to get any easier and im stuck at around or consecutive. any on exercise that could me build strength for more pullups be much appreciated also i have a much easier time doing the first half of the pullup than the last half. getting my arm to a rightangle is easy but then past that and especially pulling my chest to the bar is incredibly difficult.

2435,1, about reverse push up equipment i you can do those in a smith rack but i have the spacemoney for it. i remember you could buy these oversized ft tall pushup handle for doing dip which you could also use for doing reverse pushup aka australian pullup or bodyweight row but is there any common name to refer to this equipment im finding it a real pain to do search on place i can order them online. vagely remember some guide on how you can make your own buying pvc pipe from a hardware store home depot but cant find it again... also im over so pvc make me a bit nervous i id prefer metal even if that mean it heavier to cart around just so i it wont snap. i used to have this setup where i had a steel bar id balance across some cinderblocks i had stacked up but this wa very wobbly and unsafe so i ended up dismantling it. for bar all the way.
2436,1,people who count calories. how do you reach your goal i.e maintenance fat loss muscle gain etc. 
2437,1, for on a flexible routine i have a one month baby but i am to get back into some sort of routine again. in the past i have flipped between bodyweight and weight lifting with no real goal aside from basic heath and weight maintenance. i tried to get back into a routine but i feel i am too tired for long strenuous sessions. i am lucky enough to have access to some home equipment pullup bar dip bar bench dumbells. i also work from home and over the last week i have just been doing smaller set of pushup pullups and bodyweight squat throughout the day just to prevent a complete loss of strength. are there any routine built around several small session throughout a day i am very aware this sort of routine probably wont be a good a standard session but i am really just trying to keep my health in check until life get a little more stable again.

2448,1,why am i weaker in public 
2449,1,how to incorporate callisthenic exercise into my training routine really some here hello. im male kg at around bodyfat. my english can sometimes suck because im not a native speaker so sorry about that. i recently made a post here about why am i losing my pull up gain so fast whenever im not practicing them. theres what that post wa for short if for some reason if i do any pull ups in the span of day i lose around rep from my pr and it take me a week of daily pull ups do regain my strength back. in order to maintain my pr i to do at least set per day usually till failure and if i want to improve i do several set a day. if i really go at it i do set of different pull up variation in a single workout x chin ups x normal pull ups x wide pull ups x neutral grip pull ups and x close grip pull ups. however i got told in the comment im overtraining and doing myself more harm than good with this kind of training. i got told i should switch to weighted pull ups only with a weight with i can limit myself to set of reps. i workout around time per week at the gym and i usually do some cardio after each of my workouts. what i want tho is to take it a step further with callisthenics and get into harder elements. honestly ive been neglecting everything but the pull ups. i just love doing pull ups but again i want to achieve thing the planche front lever human flag one arm pull ups etc one day. heres where im at now in term of my callisthenics prs chin ups pull ups kg x weighted chin ups minute and second dead hang dip push ups minute plank pistol squat decent form muscle ups both hand over the bar at the same time bad form muscle ups with my left hand over the bar first and i can get myself in the front lever position but i cant hold it for more than a second or so. i can also do a lot of different variation of those exercise but im not gonna list everything. i have a pull up bar at home and somebody recommended me to get some ring are they worth it what other product this i should get how should i incorporate my bodyweight exercise into my workout routine so far ive been just doing pull ups every day push ups and plank whenever i remembered and ill sometimes randomly search for callisthenic workout on youtube and doing them. should i add some bodyweight exercise into my gym workout or should i just have bodyweight workout all together ive been adding arm wrestling exercise into my arm workout too. so im now already doing different kind of workout and im starting to get very lost on how to organise them. any tip be greatly appreciated.

2500,1,i usually consume .. per kg of protein. is this okay im m and i am an active person doing workout a week in a gym. i am and weigh which is a healthy weight. im here to ask about the protein intake im taking daily because recently i read an article forgot the title that too much protein could harm my kidney. per kilogram is about gram of protein daily but i sometimes could go a little higher around . i am clean bulking not eating crappy food such a fast food but i do eat lean meat and mostly dairy for my diet. my protein came from dairy mostly cup of cottage cheese at night cup of greek yogurt and about of lowfat milk also some piece of tysons chicken breast strip which i cook in an oven. i for sure if this protein intake can cause any harm to my body in the long term but i have only done this week ago and have never seen any significant symptom of any sickness but instead seen an improvement in my physique and have gotten stronger lifting weight and can perform more set and rep than consuming le protein before. is this okay if i gonna keep this journey forward or shall i just decrease my protein intake to reduce the might consequence in the future provide at least evidence of why protein high protein intake can harm kidneys. i will fully appreciate yall answer down below people. note this is my first time posting in and i if my writing is understandable but i hope it does.

2517,1,working out gave me man boob for context i started similar to the rr almost month ago. i turned day ago. im in the really late stage of puberty in fact i might have ended puberty already so i that could have caused my man boob i have very low fat sub percent at least. i it not caused by fat in the chest area but rather breast tissue ive heard working out may have given me a huge surge of testosterone which may have caused temporary gynecomastia but i havent felt any increase in libido or my voice so i my testosterone increased rapidly if at all. i did start quite a bit of milk for my protein to daily according to rough estimates. peanut butter and rolled oat too. i just found out these food are high in estrogen. could that be it there seems to be conflicting information on whether or not plant based estrogen affect the human body or whether estrogen trace in milk is enough to have any sort of effect

2549,1,why am i losing my pull up gain so fast hello. im male kg at around bodyfat if this is somehow relevant. i love doing pull ups they are my favourite callisthenic exercise. i can do pull ups and chin ups but in order to maintain this i must do at least two set every day. there are day i just forget about it or im just too busy or tired to do any and it seems if i skip day i always lose around rep from my pr and it take around a week to recover it. if i want to improve then i to do several set a day if not i just stagnate. im still mind blown of how easy i lose my pull up skill compared to other exercises. i wonder why is that tho and if it for everyone
2550,1,why is it so easy to lose pull up strength 
2551,1,cant gain anymore muscle should i dirty bulk ive always heard dirty bulking is unnecessary and that u can constantly make gain on a good thought out diet. i havent seen any significant gain over the last year my training is dialed in i get plenty of sleep and my diet already look kinda most people dirty bulk a ive been trying to consistently add calorie each week that my weight and strength doesnt change. im foot tall and i weigh around . ive been trying to eat around k calorie a day although my average is probably closer to since i have a life outside of fitness and i cant plan around it. i estimate my body fat percentage to be around i have deep cut on all my ab including the bottom two. i really want to get fat and i love the way i look but i also want to start making gain again. im thinking about keeping my diet the way it is but adding calorie in mass gainer in the mourning and at night. just before with work and life and shit i cant increase my calorie that much more through diet without eating complete junk so i figured mass gainer be the way to go. so my current news year resolution is to get fat but i really want want to. is this my only option left a a natural to try and get bigger and thought or input be super helpful
2552,1,diet relared.gaining fat should i stop bulking or not. my plan wa to bulk from to kg and it started after september. i check my weight on th of december and it showed . kg but when i checked my physique in front of the mirror i noticed i gained fat on my lower belly and side and a little on my chest although my upper ab are visible but but lower abdomen still ha fat.. although my calisthenic performance did go up during the bulk. i can do strict to rep for set and around rep for my th and th set same story with pull ups and leg raise squat. my overall performance increased when i compare to my kg self and i have more energy throughout the day. so shall i go on bulking till my goal or shall i do a cut till kg is it normal to get fat during bulk

2598,1,antagonistic pairs an absolute time saver here to share some workout tip it is quite common to see straight set just straight people . it go this push ups for set of rep or x . this mean you do the st set rest then nd set rest then rd set...etc. while this is straight forward ok ill stop with the pun it actually take a lot of time not to mention youll to rest more a you fatigue the same group of muscle then imagine repeating that process for exercise a better way be to do antagonistic pairs which mean pairing exercise that us opposing movement pattern and emphasis opposing muscle groups. for the upper body this mean pairing a pull movement with a push movement. for the lower body this mean pairing a squat movement with a hinge movement. a sample workout could be assisted one arm chin up set x rep rest min planche push up set x rep rest min weighted pistol squat set x rep rest min nordic hamstring curl set x rep rest min this mean you do a for set rest then a for set rest back to a for set rest...etc. this method minimizes overall workout time while maximizing rest time for individual exercise which mean you can keep the intensity high trying applying this to your next workout and comment below for and inquiry p. s. not here to say that straight set work but they just take up too much time. i also generally advise full body or upperlower split over pushpulllegs which work better for the general population in term of rest and recovery in my opinion of course.

2607,1,discussing workouts and calisthenics goals..... how to make your own. i see a lot of post here talking about workouts. my belief is that workout should really be your own so you to understand your body and work towards towards your goals. i workout on ring roughly time a week aside from a complicated shoulder dislocation about month ago i have done this for about years. my workout are flexible paying attention to how my body feel to avoid injury and also keeping my goal in my mind. my goal are never on body appearance but focus on calisthenics skills. for these reason i have a fluid workout program which ha the added important benefit of preventing boredom from repeating the same exercise over and over again. this workout travel through foundational exercise such a the back lever pelican curl and muscle up variation a we learn and condition towards the backwards roll or felge. the static exercise of the back lever and front lever straddle are advanced to a dynamic transition and the muscle up is upgraded to a forward felge or rolling muscle up. i find it fun and challenging maybe it can give you some idea for your routine enjoy
2608,1,earn or overcome your bad habit with exercise folk i have for you some trickshacks i use to slow down my bad habit with exercise. squats while brushing your teeth bad habit you brush for a very short time because it boring. if you use an electric brush they usually have a minute timer. do squat a you brush your teeth in the morning and at night. youll actually end up lasting the whole minute and getting a great workout while at it minute workout before that bad habit bad habit that extra coffee cup that first beer or alcoholic drink have that cigarette etc... before doing you is not good for you earn it with a minute workout . btw if you have an ios device you can use a free app i wrote handstand quest with no ad to follow the minute workout. pushups or core every hour during work day bad habit you work too much. in fact the work day mostly go from am to pm with you stuck in your chair or standing. to get your body moving constantly and avoid backnext injury do your favorite exercise ex push ups crunch squat stretch etc.. every one hour throughout the day for a many rep you are comfortable with. feel free to change it up and keep it to minute max so you keep coming back.

2611,1, me modify my routine been working out for about a year now and to add to it. kg. the goal is much just to keep getting bigger and stronger. progress is good so far. tldr of my problem at the bottom of the post. started with the recommended routine but it wa taking too long each day so i switched to a ppl day split that i saw on the sub. i being complimented on my arm so there an extra section dedicated to them on leg day. rest period is minute between sets. i try to do the minute athlean x ab workout every other day but it frustrating me in that because the exercise are duration based it very difficult to track progressprogressive overload. so thats my first id a very quick ab workout that i can progressively overload. i have a pullup bar and a dipl sit bar available to me. the workout go this currently push weighted ring dip kg elevated rto pushup elevated rto pushup set to failure pull chest to bar pullups ring row chest to bar pullup set to failure legs arms pistol squats or kg weighted bulgarian split squats depending on how my knee are feeling that day reverse nordic curls with hand on head it seems to make it harder to pull back up again kg bicep curls kg hammer curl into overhead press problemsquestions last time i asked for with the routine people told me to add to it. now at the end of my workout i am often unable to even one more rep but id to try to add to it anyway. id to add one more type of exercise to my workout on push and pull day. however in the format i i be too tired to perform optimally across all of those sets. is it feasible for me to do for exercise rather than for two exercise if it is viable to do that then what should my next exercise be on push day i wa thinking of buying a bench to bench press on. its easy to progressively overload and ive heard you can build good size with it. if that is a good idea i still to budget for one first so what could i do in the meantime on pull day i have a clue what to add. on legsarms day im okay leaving it a it is my leg look fine and bss into nordic curl are absolutely enough for me. i fucking hate working leg so if i add more to it i id ever work leg again as i said earlier id to find a short minute ab workout where i can track progressive overload. all very much appreciated.

2616,1,typewriter pullups with doorway bar so a background my workout routine is basically the same a rr but i added three set of chinups and headstand pushup rather than replacing pullups and ring pushup because i didnt want to neglect any muscle groups. this ha worked well for me since the added chinups have done a lot to improve my pullups while improving my biceps a bit more than pullups by themselves. now im close to doing pullchinups and im thinking about how im going to do typewriter with my current setup. i use ring and a door frame pullup bar which is great so far but doesnt really give me enough room to do typewriter ive tried and while i can kind of move to the side either way i definitely cant straighten my arm. that said ring typewriter might be possible but not side to side. moving one arm forward rather than to the side provide the same benefit a standard ring typewriter i can pull my leg up enough to provide enough strap length for the motion i just if it count a a real typewriter pullup since im moving my assisting arm in a totally different direction. and yes i i could do weighted pullups instead or go to a playground or but the former doesnt work for me because budget while the latter doesnt work for me right now because acute neuropathy make my hand super sensitive to the winter cold and i also to spread my workout throughout the morning so i can do work at the same time so making trip to the local playground defeat the purpose of that when i can otherwise walk foot to my closet.

2629,1,how to incorporate drop set into a calisthenics routine how to have a timeefficient routine rate my dropset routine yesterday on this subreddit i asked a tangentially related to how to make my workout shorter and someone told me to look at the microroutine strategy from reddeltaproject youtube channel. one of the strategy wa incorporating dropsets. however im not exactly sure how hard the dropsets should exactly be where to stop and how many they should be. i assume you should obviously reduce the total number of sets. i created this routine for my push day containing two drop set per muscle group instead of and they are very hard dropsets. i just finished the routine and i feel my muscle are about to disintegrate. it look this push dropset decline pppus gt pppus gt diamond pushup gt pushups gt incline pushup gt knee pushup gt incline knee pushup gt wall pushup gt knee wall pushup squat dropset the assisted pistol squat are when i myself by holding onto a sort of handle with either finger or the whole hand dumbbell pistol squat gt onefinger assisted pistol squat gt twofinger assisted pistol squat gt hand assisted pistol squat gt bulgarian split squat gt squats each miniset taken to or close to failure. repeat the push dropset twice and do the squat dropset once. finish the workout. repeat time a week for a pushpullpushpullpushpullrest routine. this reduces the total number of set from push set and squat set to push set and squat set although the set themselves are way harder. including a quick minute warmup this workout took me minutes. is this overtraining undertraining on one hand you could say im doing push set per workout but on the other hand you could say im only doing . i assume this is le effective for strength but is it a effective for hypertrophy a a typical routine the recommended routine how much it for strength that transfer to other movement hespu planche etc.

2673,1,going from decent to good at pull ups does seem to fall in the middle category of able to do at least pull ups yet unable to maintain that number of rep for several set i understand that is just too close to my current max and thus such a high intensity with close to rep left in the tank will naturally lead to being able to do le rep on the next set but it seems so difficult to get to consistent set of . i people recommend weighted training to increase rep and that is one option i have been trying. ideally i get to the point where cranking out good pull ups exerts a similar amount of exhaustion a performing pushup not really anywhere near failure but a large pump from all the volume. pull up pro who have been in my shoe how did yall get from where i am to where i want to be appreciate all discussion and opinion.

2710,1,on the use of creatine i used to complain a lot in high school about how i wa working out consistently and wasnt getting any stronger. well i wa i guess but at an extremely slow rate. recently i starting taking whey protein powder that ha creatine in it i didnt even what creatine was. i noticed that during my gym session i wa noticeably stronger and able to train longer my muscle visibly bigger too. my theory is that my genetic makeup cause my cell to have naturally very low atp store and thats why i feel such a dramatic difference from creatine. i wa always training to failure but i my muscle were failing so fast that there wa not enough muscle damage and time under tension to make gains. it finally feel a linear progression where every gym session i am a little bit stronger than i wa last time. my is what if i stop taking creatine but continue working out will i just go back to being just a weak and a i wa before will my progress go back to being extremely slow

2718,1,isometrics and hiit im on vacation right now so all i have is my body because i have anywhere to hang my rings. however ive always been interested in isometrics. i by itself it can make you strong and grow muscle if you repeat the effort of second on different positions. i.e. pull ups or pullspush ups or dip or pike or handstand squat and it variations. so i decided to try it out. so id do first s of each major body part. squats resting on the wall you can do a horse stance then pull ups or row hanging making sure to squeeze the late and back and any other body part you want done then on dipspush ups or pike or variation you hold the position without locking out. thing. by doing this you get an easy body weight strength training. and you can do it in a circuit. after one circuit of this i do burpees of s. i then do these two circuit repeatedly. takes around minute a day. very fun and quick.
2719,1,cheap weight vest you can just buy drawstring backpack and fill it with rock or sand and use it for pushup and dip and pullups etc. i also carry it up and down a hill and hold it in my arm close to my chest and do lunge and calf raise etc.. im also doing front raise for deltoid with it a well. this backpack is very thick for a drawstring backpack and is holding well with about pound of rock in it. im away from home for week and this and some pushup bar and trx handle connected to a rope over a tree limb in the back yard are doing wonders. you may want to get a few thick heavy duty black trash bag and put them over each other and put them into the back pack and then fill the backpack with rock or sand and once filled cut off the excess bag and tie it off. i find this backpack is better than a weight vest a i actually hurt my shoulder while doing pullups with a weight vest. the loop that go over the shoulder on the weight vest wa very thick and dense and i assume what it did wa displace my should and arm where it connects to my body and made me do a pullup at a not so normal angle and injured my shoulder. with these thick drawstring you wont get that. also they hurt a much a you might the drawstring cord is probably rds of an inch thick. here is the backpack i bought just ordered another. smidanjueorgsyamprefchktypimgtodp here are the trx style handles. refppxpopmobbasintitle
2720,1,new to body weight workout any workout plan recommendation im m and somewhat recently got into working out. i do mainly body weight although i do a few thing with barbell mainly for bigger arms. i just kind of do what i is right and include a mix of every body weight workout i can of but i really what im doing. for a sort of perspective on my ability so far im lb and i can do pullups after im warmed up my pushup go to max and i can plank for maybe a minute or so at max. not sure what that say to experienced people just trying to give a perspective of what ive worked up to so far. im mainly doing body weight workout to put on mass increase my agility and physical capability and without buying any more equipment than the barbell i already have and my free standing pullup bar. any recommendation for body weight workout plan to put me on the path im aiming for im willing to pay but with all the free resource out there im paying only a the last resort. 
2721,1,my progress after one week of body weight exercise yro lb i came up with the idea of testing my body to see if i could start exercising again. i started doing jumping jack knee pushup too heavy right now and second plank whilst playing basketball i started tuesday and just got finished with my little workout. but during the past few day ive noticed a big change in my body. i didnt lose weight but my form is starting to come back. for the last few month ive grown taller and stayed the same weight from but up until a few month i looked out of shape. to playing football i gained a somewhat muscular form and the exercise have made me feel better. my calf have started to get harder and youre able to see the muscle outline of them my arm are getting a little more toned and im able to jump higher. ive always been able to do plank but now i feel a if my stomach ha gotten tighter. and i look good in hoodies now. im starting to believe i have fast metabolism because it only been a few week or it just a placebo affect but either way im loving it. but dew to my weight my back ha been starting to hurt after i landed wrong after a layup. it hasnt been the full week but i itll be even better once i start to do this full time ive also noticed a boost in confidence when out in public. after this im thinking of getting into strength training but i my parent will listen ive tried losing weight in the past but they keep supplying me with junk food and the urge is hard to resist. im also thinking of getting into boxing for endurance since ill be trying out for the basketball team next semester.

2744,1,fat gain with recommended routine i spent a number of year trying to increase my metabolic rate while weight training x per week and this put me in a great position whereby i could much eat whatever i liked without worrying about fat gain. much a version of you cant out train a bad diet. technically you can if you training accordingly. i switched over to recommended routine a year ago and ive started to gain fat and im attributing this down to le caloric demand due to only training x per week which is half what i used to do. the workout itself is the same. the intensity is just a high but the frequency is much less. i tried to increase to day whereby day were recommended routine and the day in between were skill work but the skill work just wasnt intense enough to induce enough caloric demand to match the calorie intake i wa on. im if ha experienced this and what they did about it without reducing calorie intake because the exercise themselves are tough no doubt about that but an attempted and failed handstand on an off day isnt a metabolically demanding a a deadlift or even a set of cable shoulder raise or barbell curls. ill repeat that im not taking about the actual rr. the exercise and core triplet is just a demanding. its more the day off or skill day which arent arent same

2761,1,thinking of switching to body weight fitness. 
2762,1,muscleup fellow redditors i am writing this post because i wanted to share with someon my latest achievement the muscle up and also because i wanted to deeply this amazing community for everything it ha done for me. if it wasnt for this sub i have never started bodyweight training a i wa too scared and didnt where to begin let alone achieving such an ambitious of course for myself goal. i have always been rather fit since middle school. i enjoyed playing sport and liked the idea of working out in general. therefore i joined my track and field club and fell in love with this sport. i wa completely dedicated to training and soon enough i obtained some result for those of you who are what kind of race i did i wa a sprinter. when i entered high school i wa determined to qualify for the italian championship. my time were good and the time required to qualify for the m or quarter mile for the weirdo wa feasible. for a y.o. . i committed to my training religiously and probably overtrained i never ever took a day off. i wa determined and motivated. i needed to succeed at all costs. however the week before the opening of the outdoor season i seriously injured my hamstring. unfortunately i wa not able to compete during that season. the pain wa unbearable. i wa frustrated demotivated and discouraged. for a moment i thought i wanted to give up track and field forever. fortunately my coach managed to persuade me not to quit. so i started preparing for my next season. to make a long story shorteven though it already long i got injured again and could not compete. needless to say i wa completely devastated. i didnt what to do i stopped going to the track and i also quit training. while i wa on the sofa playing youtube video back when there werent different advertisement for each freaking video i stumbled upon a video of chris heria doing a muscle up the first thing that came to my mind wa fck i want to be this guy. however i wa totally lost i hadnt the faintest idea how i had to begin. i didnt which exercise i needed to do which routine i had to follow or how to structure my training sessions. thats when i found this amazing community it wa really a blessing from heaven the first thing i did wa to read the faq. it is incredibly informative a well a clear and simple. at first i wa a bit overwhelmed i read it all in one go and probably understood only half of what wa written. nevertheless after reading it multiple time everything became extremely clear. subsequently i did my first workout. fast forward six month i bought a pullup bar and started working my way up to this complex and difficult movement. luckily i already had a good base. in fact i could perform chin ups. so i started doing x chin ups i slowly but steadily progressed until i wa able to do x chin ups. from there i moved to normal pullups then to weighted pullups. at this juncture i began to develop my explosive strength by doing chest to bar pull ups and yesterday i finally achieved my first muscle up. i this post may seem a bit or maybe pointless to many of you but a i have previously stated i wanted someone with which i could share this new experience. and more importantly i needed someone that have listened to my personal story. i never told this to any person i not even my parent i had to talk about my past experience with a person in order to vent some anger.

2779,1,is kg enough for a weighted vest for bodyweight training what weight should i get why are the weight so low i want to buy a weighted vest for bodyweight training because i to spend my money quick a the inflation is really high in my country now and it increasing. im thinking that some time in my life im gonna buy a weight vest anyway eventually so might a well buy it when the price are cheaper. i wa astounded when i saw how light most vest are. im kg and i can do about dip for example. i put about kg of weight in a backpack and i did dips. this is still out of the strength range and into the hypertrophy range and i want to also do set in the rep range in most movement and i will also get stronger and stronger in the future. yet article say that vest should not exceed of your weight kg in my case and then you have movement pushups. i can do normal pushups. i even how much weight id to put on so that my max pushup become and thats only now. sure you can progress horizontal push easier without weight but maybe you want to do that stimulates the chest more without putting the load more on the shoulder pppus or triceps diamond or without making it unilateral archeronearm or maybe i will simply the movement more in the future because of it simplicity. am i overthinking this or underestimating how hard exercise get once you add more and more weight i cant find a vest more than kg in my country thats not incredibly expensive and even those are hard to find.

2789,1,how to increase work capacity hello so ive been training for about a year now and definitely made good strength gain following the rr. i often find myself getting out of breath after a single setsay pullups i do somewhere between rep a set. i find that i to rest for a much longer time than ideal and often spend more time on my workout then id  to give you some number ill do a set of pullups rest min do shrimp squat then ill end up resting minute before i do pullups again because im so out of breath. what are some good way to build up work capacity so i stop getting so out of breath. being really strict with my rest time it probably be a struggle and id imagine i put up lower number but overtime surely id adapt i wa also thinking of maybe just throwing in a set of max rep bw squat at the end of each workout. my thinking is this build up my work capacity a id be doing rep and id get some nice leg endurance too which is always good for hiking and sports.

2796,1,bulking weight concern all ive been on a bulking endeavor for about week now. i started at around pound year old. i did a tdee calculation estimation and it listed my maintenance at pound a calorie with moderate exercise. i work a manual labor job part time and exercise day per week for about an hour per session. i currently supplementing with whey and creatine. since then i have been consuming minimum calorie a day. here is an image detailing everything i eat including macro bear in mind this is the minimum i eat a day. i often exceed this and consume over calories. i used to intermittent fast split so my stomach is used to accepting large amount of food in short time. often i will weigh myself after eating all my meal and i will clock pound heavier than what i did in the morning. some morning i weigh some morning and this afternoon i weighed on multiple scales. needless to say it can be quite demoralizing and confusing. the thing is i am getting stronger and i am progressing on my movements. my body also look slightly different from when i started. i notice some fat accumulation and my ab are starting to disappear. though maybe some rounder and fuller muscles. so there is hope there at least. is is possible my body isnt absorbing all my calorie i intake on average g of fiber a day. could this contribute to malabsorption of calorie i am not very young so it not i can attribute this to a super fast metabolism. any input be appreciated. though i suspect many answer will be eat more. so be it if thats the case.  prebulk week ago now slightly different lighting in these image but i the difference are noticeable.

2803,1,is this how recomp work are my goal unrealistic i am a year old who and lbs. my body fat is somewhere around so you can see it high. what ive heard from other fitness youtubers is teen my age should try to recomp rather than cut or bulk. and knowing that i am already skinny fat recomp is the best option for me. im trying to go on just a slight deficit at cals a day which come to about cals. at this rate i lose lb of fat per month which equates to . of my bw per week. from what ive seen of muscle gain all the youtubers say beginner could gain about lb of muscle in a year. knowing the fact that ill be on a slight deficit for some month i feel i could gain lb a year. is this estimate believable or do you gain much lesser on a cal deficit my goal are to lose about lb of fat and gain lb of me muscle in month which put me then at about bodyfat which is a healthy weight. do you my goal are unrealistic i that the fat loss thing can be calculated lb cal thing but i wanna bout muscle gain. could i realistically gain lb of muscle in month on a cal deficit

2818,1,suggestions for runner hello guy im and always trained on and off. some period with weight and some others bodyweight and yes a few year ago i did follow foundation for more than a year. a little more than a year ago i wa consistently going to the gym but with gym opening and closing i unexpectedly took up running. i now run much every day maybe out of in a week period and im trying to make sure that i do at least minute of static stretching per day i stopped doing it for a few month and i paid dearly in flexibility and i also got some pain in my heel but now that im stretching regularly again thing are improving even though my range of motion is still way le than before starting running. the result of all of this is that i havent done strength training in a year. also because of bad eating habit im probably kg heavier than i should be. long preamble to ask for suggestion on how to gradually get back in strength training at home. i doable because with mh running every day and stretching every day and these two are my priority if i start a routine that is too demanding is not going to stick. also my running program is very varied different speed sprint interval etc... so im not sure that i even any additional leg work. im at the minimalist routine a a good option. what do you guy and also how many time per week and how many circuit be best in my situation my goal are strength and health. 
2819,1,i got hypothetically 
2820,1,how and why to do a reverse nordic curl one of the most challenging body weight leg exercise out there tldr why do reverse nordic in the first place todays writeup and video is all about the reverse nordic curl what it is why you should be doing it and how to get your first one first of all why should we even consider doing the reverse nordic at all theres actually a very good reason for for it. quadriceps anatomy your quadriceps are comprised of four muscle three of them vastus medialis intermedius and lateralis act exclusively to extend the knee his is because the vastus group only cross the knee a muscle that only cross one joint is known a monoarticulate. the fourth quad rectus femoris is biarticulate or it cross both the hip and the knee and act to extend the leg a well a being one of the primary muscle involved in flexing the hip. put simply when the rec fem contract it is going to either flex your hip or extend your knee. lets use the squat a an example although this is true any time both our knee and hip are flexed at the bottom position to stand out of the squat i to contract my quad to extend my knee whilst simultaneously extending my hip to finish standing. but remember that the rectus femoris want to actually flex the hip a it straightens the knee and it creates a lot of hip flexion torque when it doe this. we have a problem here if my rectus femoris powerfully contract from this position it will straighten my knee but at the same time it will try to pull my torso further forward into hip flexion which is not how you stand up out of a squat to be able to stand up out of a squat or a lunge without fighting our own muscle our central nervous system ha to get involved. our brain is smart so what it going to do is preferentially use the quad arent going to pull our hip forward a they contract so the workaround is the cns preferentially recruit the three vastus quadriceps because they only extend the knee and do nothing at the hip. so the moral of the story is that squat lunge leg press and other exercise that require the quad to straighten the knee while the hip is flexed are great for training the the vastus group but those movement do not create enough mechanical tension in the rectus femoris to induce hypertrophy. or in other word if your rec fem to grow you to train it directly . meatloaf once said aint bad but in this case working out of quad is bad or at the very least you want to neglecting one of them rectus femoris is large and powerful and for complete leg development it cant be missed so how do we train the rec fem specifically well in exercise that extend or straighten the knee whilst the hip stay in extension the rectus femoris is just a if not more active than the vastus group. so to train the rectus femoris we a movement that extends the knee whilst our hip remains fixed in extension. the perfect exercise to achieve that is the reverse nordic curl. mobility consideration but first a checkpoint. are you comfortable sitting in deep knee flexion under load are you free from any kind of knee pain if yes then the reverse nordic curl is for you the reverse nordic through it full range of motion is putting the knee through it full range of knee flexion so you to be able to achieve that range of motion in the classic kneeling recfem stretch shin flat on the wall and upper back in contact with the wall before you attempt to put your knee extensor under load at such an acute angle. how to perform a reverse nordic and progressions. to perform a reverse nordic curl begin kneeling on a padded surface. squeeze your glute and ab to brace your core and kneel tall so your body is in a straight line from your femur to the top of your head. from here keeping your torso in a vertical position and hip extended slowly lean backwards by bending at the knees. lower yourself down into the movement gradually a far a you can comfortably control the movement and return to the starting position by extending the knee. given that the further we lower into the movement the more torque will be going through our knee joint and we will have to create more knee extension torque to raise ourselves back up. this mean the exercise will get harder the lower you go into it so if you are unable to achieve full range in the reverse nordic curl to lower the difficulty just reduce the range of motion until your strength increases. so thats the simplest way to progress towards the reverse nordic just gradually increase the range of motion over time. another benefit of doing it this way is that your flexibility will increase in tandem with your strength level. another way of progressing towards a full reverse nordic is to do an assisted nordic with either a band or a cable set up to assist you a you go down. the benefit of using a band is that the elastic force of the band increase in the same way a the torque at the knee doe meaning the lower you go into the movement the higher the strength demand on your quad become but the band is also helping more and more the deeper you go. using a cable machine doe not have this accommodating elastic force it is just a static force assisting you the same way throughout the entire movement. this isnt the worst thing though because you can choose a resistance level that is sufficient to you at the bottom because you will only that at the bottom the rest of the movement is easy by comparison. over time once you get stronger at the bottom position you can decrease the amount of assistance and work twwards your full bodyweight reverse nordic. so
