    "## About Lexicon Models\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the approaches to sentiment analysis is the lexicon-based approach. Lexicon means the vocabulary of a person, language or branch of knowledge. Here, in lexicon based sentiment analysis, we already have a given set of dictionary of words with each labelled as positive negative, neutral sentiments along with polarity, parts of speech and subjectivity classifiers, mood, modality and the like [source](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/sentiment-analysis-lexicon-models-vs-machine-learning-b6e3af8fe746). Simply put, each and every word in the dictionary contains a corresponding sentiment score to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique uses pre-trained lexicon-based models, which calculate the sentiment polarity of the texts or document based on these semantic orientation of lexicons or individual words. The text is first tokenized and each token is matched with the available words in the model to find out its context and sentiment. A combining function is then taken to make the final sentimental prediction regarding the total text component.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are several issues with this approach. For instance, most of the time, in online reviews or any other online text source, the presence of more positive words does not necessarily make the review to be positive or vice versa [[source]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/lexicon-based-approach). This is because the meaning of the whole corpus might be different than each individual words used, based on phrases or sentences that imply sarcasm or in a context of comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to explore three popular lexicon-based models:\n",
    "- VADER Lexicon\n",
    "- AFINN Lexicon\n",

      "absolutely the worst film yet by burton who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs. a miserable script loaded with cliche is only the first of many objectionable aspect to this film. this is the kind of movie where every time something happens you'll be sure to hear someone shout out he's lost his gun or whatever it is to let everybody know. carter is really awful and so is wahlberg who can't play this straight and be convincing. very nice effect and photography but poor music in the john williams mold by burton's crony elfman. heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch phrase from the first movie. very poor results. if anyone else out there also saw sleepy hollow they will probably have noticed a i have the declining quality of burton's films. i've heard that this particular project produced by others and that burton brought in a director in which case his judgement should be questioned. but i think he allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip the evidence is there in the films. in sleepy hollow he couldn't decide what kind of movie he making whether it a comedy or a real horror movie and the population of british character actor chris lee etc. made you also think it kind of a monster rally film those are never scary a horror fan know . the movie couldn't succeed on either horror or comedy because it so schizophrenic and no style had been developed to smooth the two together. planet of the ape is much the same way and the result come off more like total recall or tango and cash than like sci fi. he's also fallen into the rut of so many other big director of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience. word to burton if you're out there pick something and do it straight or use some style to peice it all together a in mar attack or beetlejuice or you might a well retire because people like me that are fan of your movie will stop going.\n"

      "absolutely the worst film yet by burton who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs. a miserable script loaded with cliche is only the first of many objectionable aspect to this film. this is the kind of movie where every time something happens you'll be sure to hear someone shout out he's lost his gun or whatever it is to let everybody know. carter is really awful and so is wahlberg who can't play this straight and be convincing. very nice effect and photography but poor music in the john williams mold by burton's crony elfman. heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch phrase from the first movie. very poor results. if anyone else out there also saw sleepy hollow they will probably have noticed a i have the declining quality of burton's films. i've heard that this particular project produced by others and that burton brought in a director in which case his judgement should be questioned. but i think he allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip the evidence is there in the films. in sleepy hollow he couldn't decide what kind of movie he making whether it a comedy or a real horror movie and the population of british character actor chris lee etc. made you also think it kind of a monster rally film those are never scary a horror fan know . the movie couldn't succeed on either horror or comedy because it so schizophrenic and no style had been developed to smooth the two together. planet of the ape is much the same way and the result come off more like total recall or tango and cash than like sci fi. he's also fallen into the rut of so many other big director of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience. word to burton if you're out there pick something and do it straight or use some style to peice it all together a in mar attack or beetlejuice or you might a well retire because people like me that are fan of your movie will stop going.\n"

    "TextBlob is a simple library which supports complex analysis and operations on textual data. It returns polarity and subjectivity of a sentence. Polarity lies between -1 and 1 (-1 defines a negative sentiment and 1 defines a positive sentiment). Negation words reverse the polarity. TextBlob has semantic labels that help with fine-grained analysis. For example, it takes into account emoticons and exclamation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Subjectivity lies between 0 and 1. Subjectivity quantifies the amount of personal opinion and factual information contained in the text. Higher subjectivity means that the text contains personal opinion rather than factual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, TextBlob has an intensity parameter. It calculates subjectivity by looking at the 'intensity'. Intensity determines if a word modifies the next word in the sentence. Adverbs are also used as modifiers.
